[The team continue to trek as Jack approaches Kate]

JACK: You OK?

KATE: Yeah, I just, had a rock in my shoe.

[Pause]

JACK: He didn't mean it, you know.

KATE: What?

JACK: Sawyer. When he said that he didn't want you to go with him, he didn't mean it.

KATE: He didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

JACK: I'm trying to protect you. That's why I asked you not to come back for me.

[He starts to go]

KATE: Hey. Why are you sticking up for Sawyer, he'd never do it for you.

JACK: Because I love you.

[Jack walks on, as does Kate after a moments reflection]

[Cut to Jack driving his car and looking at the newspaper clipping. He stops, and dials on his phone]

VOICEMAIL: You have reached three one zero five five five zero...

[Jack hangs up and exits his car, stepping right out into the road and almost getting run down. He enters a funeral parlor, where a closed casket is on display, and seats lined up with no-one there. The funeral director enters the room]

DIRECTOR: Can I help you?

JACK: Sorry I er. Actually I came, er, is the funeral over?

DIRECTOR: There was no funeral, sir, only a viewing. Nobody showed up.

JACK: Nobody? You sure?

DIRECTOR: Just you. [Rather disinterestedly] My deepest condolences. Friend or family?

JACK: Neither.

DIRECTOR: Would you like me to open it up?

JACK: No.

DIRECTOR: Take your time.

[Jack goes over to the casket and places his hand on it, tears in his eyes. He gets a pack of pills from his pocket, and notices he only has one left]

JACK: [Mutters] Damn it.

[He takes the pill, and leaves]

[In real-time, Jack catches up to Rousseau on their trek]

JACK: Danielle. How much further?

ROUSSEAU: About an hour.

JACK: The radio tower, when was the last time you were there?

ROUSSEAU: The day I recorded the message. I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving here.

JACK: What?

ROUSSEAU: There's no place for me back there. This is my home now.

[As they walk, they see Ben and Alex stood right ahead of them. Everyone stops, Jack steps forward]

BEN: Hello, Jack. We need to talk.

[Inside The Looking Glass, Mikhail exits the comms room]

GRETA: What did Ben say?

BONNIE: Can we kill him?

MIKHAIL: Is it possible to turn this equipment off?

BONNIE: What?

MIKHAIL: The equipment that's jamming the Island, can you turn it off?

GRETA: Sure. Ben gave us the code.

MIKHAIL: You are the only ones who have it?

BONNIE: Yeah. Why?

MIKHAIL: What would happen if this station were to be flooded?

GRETA: Nothing. The casing for the equipment is waterproof, it'll keep going forever.

MIKHAIL: Then why do you need to be here?

BONNIE: Because Ben told us to. We were following orders.

MIKHAIL: And you never asked why?

BONNIE: No. Because I trust him. And I trust Jacob. And the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing, everything that we're doing here falls apart.

MIKHAIL: [To Greta] She makes an excellent point.

[He shoots Greta, who falls into the water. Bonnie runs, and Mikhail shoots her in the back. He kicks her over]

BONNIE: No, please.

MIKHAIL: I'm sorry, Bonnie, I too am following orders.

[Desmond emerges]

DESMOND: Hey!

[He shoots Mikhail with the speargun in the chest. Bonnie tries to grab his gun. Desmond gets it first and points it at her]

CHARLIE: No, Des, no, don't. We need her.

[Jack and Ben stand opposite each other inland. Kate heads off to take the flank, as Jack goes to Ben and circles him]

BEN: [To Naomi] Hi, I'm Benjamin, I don't believe we've had the pleasure...

JACK: Don't talk to him! [To Ben] What do you want?

BEN: Just a moment of your time. To talk, you and me, alone.

JACK: For what?

BEN: Jack you've just killed seven of my people, the least you can give me is five minutes.

[Rose and Sun exchange anxious looks. Kate arrives back to Jack]

JACK: He alone?

KATE: There's only two sets of tracks, his and hers.

JACK: Five minutes.

[Ben nods, as he leads on taking Jack away, Jack grabs Ben's walkie]

[Cut to Jack picking up a prescription]

PHARMACIST: I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.

JACK: Ah, that's a mistake. I er, I only refilled it twice, could you check again?

PHARMACIST: I did check it again Doctor Shephard, and that was the third refill so there's nothing I can do.

JACK: Fine. I've got another prescription right here.

MAN: Hey, I know you. You're the hero.

JACK: I'm not a hero.

MAN: Yeah yeah, we saw it on TV. Hey lady, what's wrong with you? Just give this guy whatever he needs. Do you know what he did?

JACK: Here it is, here. Oxycodone.

PHARMACIST: Doctor Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.

JACK: That's not me, that's Doctor Christian Shephard, I'm Doctor Jack Shephard, he's my father.

PHARMACIST: I'm gonna have to call your father's office to confirm this.

JACK: He's out of town right now.

PHARMACIST: Well I'm sure somebody in the office...

[Jack slams on the counter]

JACK: Don't bother.

[He leaves, knocking over a fixture as he goes]

[Jack follows Ben away from the main group]

BEN: Have a seat.

[Jack does so with Ben]

BEN: Not so long ago, Jack. I made a decision, that took the lives of over forty people in a single day. I'm telling you this because, history is about to repeat itself, right here, right now.

JACK: Let me guess, you've got us surrounded, and if I don't do what you say you're gonna, you're gonna kill all my people.

BEN: No Jack, you are.

[Jack laughs]

JACK: And how am I going to do that, Ben?

BEN: The woman you're travelling with. The one who parachuted onto the Island from that helicopter. She's not who she says she is.

JACK: She's not, huh?

BEN: No she's not.

JACK: Then who is she?

BEN: She's a representative of some people who've been trying to find this Island, Jack. She's one of the bad guys.

JACK: Oh, I almost forgot, you're the, you're the good guys.

BEN: Jack, listen to me. If you phone her boat, every single living person on this Island will be killed. So here's what has to happen. Get that device, the phone she carries with her, and give it me. I will turn around, we'll go back to my people, you will turn around and go back to your people.

JACK: I'm not going anywhere.

[They both stand confrontationally]

BEN: May I have my walkie back?

JACK: What?

BEN: There's something you need to hear. Please.

[Jack gives it him]

BEN: Tom, are you there?

TOM: Yes, I'm here.

BEN: [To Jack] Your plan killed seven of my people, but the one's that you failed to kill are now holding your friends. Jin, Sayid, Bernard. At gunpoint.

SAYID: Jack don't give him anything!!!

[Sounds of a struggle can be heard over the walkie]

BERNARD: Leave him alone!!

RYAN: I said shut up!!

[A thud signals Ryan hitting someone]

JACK: And what's to stop me from snapping your neck?

BEN: [Quickly] Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them.

TOM: Got it.

[Ben looks at his watch]

RYAN: I said don't move!!

BEN: Bring me the phone, Jack.

SAYID: Don't negotiate with him...

JIN: No!

BEN: Forty seconds.

JACK: No. I'm getting them all off the Island. All of them!!

BEN: Let me ask you something, Jack. Why do you wanna leave the Island? What is it that you so desperately want to get back to? You have no-one. Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's twenty seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack.

JACK: No.

BEN: Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.

JACK: No.

BEN: I'm not bluffing!

JACK: I WON'T DO IT!!!

BEN: Five. Four. Three...

JACK: No.

[Pause]

[Three shots sound over the mike]

BEN: I'm so sorry, Jack.

[Jack attacks Ben, hitting him numerous times and causing his own knuckles to bleed. He grabs the walkie]

JACK: Tom. Are you there?

TOM: Yeah, Jack, I hear you.

JACK: I'm going to lead my people up to the radio tower. And I'm gonna make a call. And I'm gonna get em all rescued, every one of them. And then I'm gonna come find you, and I'm gonna kill ya.

[At The Looking Glass, Charlie has been set free by Desmond]

CHARLIE: What's the code?

BONNIE: Go away.

CHARLIE: Bonnie, let's just get this over with, OK? What's the code?

DESMOND: She's not gonna tell you, brother.

CHARLIE: Yeah she's gonna tell me.

DESMOND: What makes you say that?

CHARLIE: Because you said it's my destiny to turn off that jammer. OK, Bonnie, we're both gonna die down here. All right, let's be perfectly honest. A one-eyed maniac just killed your friend, he shot you in the back. It would appear that your glorious leader, Ben, put him up to it. Are you a sodding idiot? You have the opportunity to make Ben very very angry. Why would you not take that?

BONNIE: Five, four, five...

CHARLIE: What?

BONNIE: Eight, seven, sev-...

CHARLIE: Is that the code?

BONNIE: Five, five, four, three, seven, seven...

CHARLIE: Start again.

BONNIE: Six, one.

CHARLIE: Stop, Bonnie. Start from the beginning, start again. Bonnie, Bonnie! Wake up, stop. Bonnie, start again.

BONNIE: Good vibrations.

CHARLIE: What?

BONNIE: Beach boys. Good vibrations. On the keypad, the numbers, they're notes. It was programmed by a musician.

[Bonnie loses consciousness. Charlie and Desmond exchange looks]

[Inland, Jack drags a bloody Ben back to the main group, and throws him on the ground]

JACK: Tie him up. He's coming with us.

[Jack walks on and Kate chases after him. Alex approaches Ben, and Danielle approaches Alex]

ALEX: What?

BEN: [Sighs] Alex. This is your mother.

[They stare at each other, Rousseau holding back tears]

ROUSSEAU: I'll help you tie him up.

[Kate catches up to Jack]

KATE: What happened? What he say?

JACK: It's not important right now. Just, get everything together...

KATE: Jack. Your knuckles. Here.

[Kate cleans them for him]

KATE: What happened?

JACK: He killed them. Bernard, Jin, Sayid, all three of them. He radioed the beach. And I let it happen. I had to let it happen. We can't tell Rose, or Sun, not yet. We gotta keep moving, I promised Sayid, that we would keep moving.

KATE: So why did you bring him back? Why didn't you just kill him?

JACK: Because I want him to see it. I want him to experience the moment that we get off this Island, and I want him to know that he failed. And then I'll kill him.

[At the beach, Ryan and Tom argue as they walk]

RYAN: It was an order, Tom, we had to follow it.

TOM: Ben doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, he's lost it! I mean look at what they did to us. Instead of putting three bullets in the damned sand, we should have killed them for real.

[Sayid, Jin and Bernard are still tied up with a third Other pointing his gun at them]

[Further away, Juliet and Sawyer observe]

SAWYER: All they got left is three guys and four guns.

JULIET: And all we've got, James, are two people and no guns.

SAWYER: So we'll wait till night.

JULIET: That isn't going to change the fact that we're unarmed, if you wanna kill yourself, fine, but before you go I can try...

SAWYER: Shh! You hear that?

[They turn to see the DHARMA van drive right by them. Hurley drives it through a tent and straight towards Ryan and Tom. Tom dives out of the way while Ryan fires at Hurley. He misses, however, and Hurley ploughs right into him]

MALE OTHER: Ryan!!!

[Hurley brakes and prepares to get out of the van. Sawyer pushes the car door back shut]

HURLEY: Woo!

SAWYER: Stay in the bus, Hugo.

[Sawyer grabs Ryan's gun off the ground, and jumps out round the front at the male Other. Sayid kicks him, knocking him down before he can fire at Sawyer. Sayid then wraps his legs round his neck, breaking it before Sawyer shoots. Jin, Bernard and Sawyer all look with surprise, as Sayid nods to Sawyer. Tom crawls to another gun on the ground, but Juliet grabs it and steps on his hand, causing him to cry out with pain]

JULIET: [Points the gun at him] Stay right there, Tom.

TOM: [Turns to Sawyer] OK. I give up.

[Sawyer pauses, then shoots him in the chest, surprising Juliet]

SAWYER: That's for taking the kid off the raft.

HURLEY: Dude it was over, he surrendered.

SAWYER: I didn't believe him.

[Cut to Jack in a hospital]

[Jack raids a medicine cabinet, and gets some oxycodone. He takes some, and pockets more. He then leaves, but knocks over files]

DR. HAMILL: What are you doing, Doctor Shephard?

[Jack turns to see Hamill at the door]

JACK: I was just er, I just just checking the er, the Arland charts. Just wanted to, just wanted to see how the operation went.

DR. HAMILL: I left three messages on your voice mail, you didn't get them?

JACK: My phone's broken.

DR. HAMILL: Let's go to my office, Jack.

JACK: For what?

DR. HAMILL: We need to have a talk. Come on.

JACK: You know, I know that you're, you're new around here, so you don't know much about...

DR. HAMILL: I know enough. But let's just walk down to my office...

JACK: If you've got something to say to me, you can say it to me, right here.

DR. HAMILL: [To a nurse] Will you excuse us, please?

[The nurse leaves]

DR. HAMILL: Mrs Arland, the woman you saved, woke up in recovery about two hours ago. She was in some pain but highly responsive to the reflex test and entirely lucid.

JACK: That's... that's great.

DR. HAMILL: But then she described the series of events that caused her accident. She says she was driving over the bridge when she saw man standing on top of the railing, about to jump off. She was distracted, lost control of her car. She ran into the median, rolled over and was hit by the van behind her. So the obvious question here, Jack, is how did you get to that flaming car so fast? What were you doing on that bridge?

JACK: Do you know how many years I've worked at this hospital? Do you know anything about me? Do you have any idea what I've been through?

DR. HAMILL: How much have you had to drink today, Jack?

JACK: OK, I'll tell you what, you do this. You get my father down here, get him down here right now, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me. [Pause] Don't you look at me like that. Don't you, pity me.

DR. HAMILL: I'm trying to help you.

JACK: You can't help me!!

[Everyone in the ward stares. Jack walks away]

[Out in the jungle, Jack leads the group with Rousseau toward the tower. Ben's walkie which he carries suddenly springs to life]

HURLEY: Attention, Others. Come in, Others. If you're listening in, I want you to know that we got you bastards. And, unless the rest of you wanna be blown up, you best stay away from our beach...

[Everyone stops and listens]

JACK: Hurley?

HURLEY: Jack?

JACK: Where are you, what's going on?

HURLEY: Dude. I'm back at the beach.

JACK: What?

HURLEY: Yeah I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer I, I saved them.

JACK: They're OK, Juliet and...

HURLEY: Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard. We're all...

JACK: What, wait. Bernard and Jin and Sayid, they're with you?!

HURLEY: Yeah dude, I told you, I saved em all.

[Everyone shouts with relief and hug, and Rose and Sun hug notably]

JACK: Hey, stay where you are, we're almost up to the tower. You'll be safer there.

HURLEY: Yeah I got ya, we'll stay put until you like, phone home.

[Everyone continues to cry happily as Claire steps forward]

CLAIRE: [Into the walkie] What about Charlie, did he make it back yet?

HURLEY: Not yet, but they're probably paddling home as we speak. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.

[Hurley looks out at an empty sea]

CHARLIE: Des? There's diving gear in those racks, yeah?

DESMOND: Aye. There's plenty.

CHARLIE: Why don't you take care of that, I'll tap out "Good Vibrations."

DESMOND: All right, mate.

CHARLIE: Hey, Des.

DESMOND: Aye?

CHARLIE: You get any flashes?

DESMOND: No, nuttin.

CHARLIE: Meet you back here then.

DESMOND: Aye.

[Charlie heads to the communication room and enters the code by entering numbers corresponding to the notes to the song. When he finishes, the yellow light goes out, and an engine of some kind seems to start up]

CHARLIE: So much for fate.

[As he leaves, a noise calls him back, a flat beep sound. A button is flashing, and Charlie reads the text under it]

CHARLIE: Incoming transmission!

[He quickly presses it, and Penelope Widmore appears on the view-screen]

PENNY: Hello?! Can you hear me?

CHARLIE: Yes, yes I can hear you.

PENNY: Who is this? Who am I speaking to?

CHARLIE: Charlie er... Charlie Pace, I'm a survivor of Flight eight-one-five, Oceanic Flight eight-one-five.

PENNY: Er... where are you?

CHARLIE: We're on an Island, we're alive.

PENNY: An Island!! Well where, what's your location?

CHARLIE: I dunno. Who's this?

PENNY: This is Penelope. Penelope Widmore. How did you get this frequency?

CHARLIE: [Shouts] Desmond? Desmond!

PENNY: Did you just say Desmond?

CHARLIE: Yeah, he's here, he's with me.

PENNY: [Smiles] Is he OK?

CHARLIE: He's brilliant! Hey, are you on the boat?

PENNY: What, what boat?

CHARLIE: Your boat, eighty miles off shore. Er... Naomi, parachutist.

PENNY: But, I'm not on a boat, who, who's Naomi?

[Desmond looks around the moon pool room, and notices Mikhail's body is missing. In the comms room, a tap at the window cause Charlie to turn. Mikhail is outside in the water, with a grenade in his hand]

PENNY: Hello, hello is Desmond there? Desmond, can you hear me? Desmond?

[Mikhail pulls the cork. Charlie turns to see Desmond running toward the room, and he rushes to close the door. As he does so, Desmond sees the video screen]

PENNY: Can you hear me?

DESMOND: Penny!!! No...

[Charlie closes the door and locks it. Mikhail lets off the grenade and the window is destroyed. Water rushes into the comms room]

DESMOND: Charlie!!!

[Charlie turns to the water as Desmond hammers against the door with a fire extinguisher. Charlie stands still then suddenly rushes, grabbing a pen from his pocket and writing on his hand desperately. He then dives down to the door window between him and Desmond, pressing his hand on the glass with the words “Not Penny's boat”. Desmond understands, and Charlie smiles. Charlie then breathes in, and he rushes backwards in the water. As he drowns, he gestures the cross on his chest]

[Out in the jungle, Aaron begins to cry in Claire's arms]

CLAIRE: Sshh. hey Aaron, it's OK, sweetie.

NAOMI: What's the matter?

CLAIRE: I dunno, I think he's just a bit scared.

NAOMI: Hard to blame him.

[Naomi's phone beeps. She looks at it, and the light is beeping green]

CLAIRE: What is it?

NAOMI: What's your boyfriend's name? The rock star who swam down to the station?

CLAIRE: Charlie, why?

NAOMI: Charlie just got us rescued.

[Naomi runs up the line of trekkers]

NAOMI: Jack!! Jack, he did it!! Your friend bloody well did it!

JACK: What?

NAOMI: The green light, it's on. The jamming's stopped.

JACK: Use it then.

NAOMI: All right.

[She dials]

VOICE: Four, four, two..

FEMALE VOICE: [Speaks in French]

NAOMI: What's this?

JACK: It's Rousseau's message, it's still blocking the signal.

ROUSSEAU: It doesn't matter. We're here.

VOICE: [On phone] Iteration one, seven, five...

[The group trek up a hill to see the radio tower dominating the sky. Inside the French message can be heard playing on loop. The recording is from a machine in the room by a speaker]

ROUSSEAU: I recorded this sixteen years ago. [To Alex] Three days before you were born. I guess we don't need it anymore.

[She turns off the recording and removes the tape]

JACK: [To Naomi] All right, do it.

[Naomi holds the phone]

NAOMI: I can't get a signal in here.

[They all exit the room and go outside, as everyone watches, including Ben who has been tied to a tree]

NAOMI: I'm getting something!

KATE: It's gonna work! It's happening, we're gonna get off of this Island!

JACK: We'll celebrate when we're home.

BEN: Jack! I know you think you're saying your people. But you need to stop this. It's a mistake.

JACK: The mistake was listening to you.

BEN: This'll be your last chance, Jack. I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end.

NAOMI: I've got it, I've got a signal!!!

BEN: Jack please, you don't know what you're doing!!

JACK: I know exactly what I'm doing.

[Naomi presses on the phone, and it says “CONNECTED”. Naomi suddenly shakes, and spurts blood from her mouth. She falls down with a knife in her back and drops the phone. Behind her, Locke moves forward]

JACK: JOHN!!!

[Locke pulls out the gun he found, and points it at Jack]

LOCKE: Step back, Jack.

JACK: What did you do?

LOCKE: What I had to. Now step back.

[Jack stays still as the phone tone signals that Naomi has made the call, and there just needs someone to answer it]

LOCKE: Stay away from the phone.

[Jack dives for it. Locke tries to destroy it, but his shot misses and Jack takes it]

JACK: What are you doing, John?

LOCKE: I don't wanna shoot you.

BEN: Do it, John! Shoot him! Do what you need to do...

[Rousseau knocks him unconscious with an elbow strike to the face. The phone continues to beep waiting for someone to pick up]

LOCKE: Please. Put the phone down.

JACK: No. You're done keeping me on this Island.

[Locke cocks the barrel]

LOCKE: I will kill you if I have to.

JACK: Then do it, John.

KATE: Jack.

[Locke pauses, and then lowers the gun]

LOCKE: Jack. You're not supposed to do this.

[The phone is answered]

MAN: Minkowski. Hello?

[Jack puts it to his ear]

JACK: Who is this?

MINKOWSKI: Who is this?

JACK: My name is Jack Shephard. Are you, are you on the boat, the freighter?

MINKOWSKI: How'd you get this channel?

[Locke can be seen leaving the area]

JACK: Naomi, Naomi told us about your search team. About the boat.

MINKOWSKI: Naomi. You found her? Where is she? Who are you?

JACK: I'm one of the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. Can you get a fix on our location?

MINKOWSKI: Hell yeah we can. Sit tight. We'll be right there.

[Everyone share grins and shrieks with happiness as Jack and Kate look at each other]

[Cut to Jack's apartment. maps scatter the table. The whole place is a mess, and Jack sits on the floor drinking alcohol, flicking his flip-phone. He dials a number, and puts it to his ear]

VOICE: Hello.

JACK: Hello? It's me. Whoa whoa, wait, don't, don't hang up, please. I know what you said, I just. I just need to see ya, please? Yeah, yeah out at the airport. You know where. Thank you.

[Jack drives to the airport and parks up. Another car approaches. Jack steps out and the car stops. Out of the darkness appears Kate Austen. It is revealed that the whole episode hasn't consisted of flashbacks, but rather flash-forwards]

KATE: Hey.

JACK: Hey.

KATE: Saw you on the news. Still pulling people out of burning wreckage, huh?

JACK: Old habits.

KATE: You look terrible.

JACK: [Laughs] Thanks.

KATE: Why did you call me, Jack?

[Jack hands her his newspaper clipping]

JACK: I was hoping that you'd heard. That maybe you'd go to the funeral.

KATE: Why would I go to the funeral?

JACK: I've been flying a lot.

KATE: What?

JACK: Yeah that golden pass that they gave us. I, I've been using it. Every Friday night I, I fly from LA to Tokyo or, Singapore, Sydney. [Laughs] And then I, I get off and I, have a drink, and then I fly home.

KATE: Why?

JACK: Because I want it to crash, Kate. I don't care about anybody else on board. Every little bump we hit or turbulence, I mean I, I actually close my eyes and I pray that I can get back.

[Kate looks near tears as does Jack]

KATE: This is not gonna change.

JACK: No, I'm sick of lying. We made a mistake.

KATE: I have to go. He's gonna be wondering where I am...

[Jack grabs her]

JACK: We were not supposed to leave.

KATE: Yes, we were.

[She releases herself]

KATE: Goodbye, Jack.

[She heads for her car]

JACK: We have to go back, Kate.

[She gets in her car and drives away]

JACK: We have to go back!!

[A plane takes off over Jack's head]
