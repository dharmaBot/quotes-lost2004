[A heavily-bearded Jack sits on a plane sipping a drink, as a stewardess walks down the aisle]

STEWARDESS: Would you fasten your seatbelts? Would you put your seatbelt back on, please?

WOMAN: Oh.

STEWARDESS: Would you fasten your seatbelt, please?

[Jack taps her on the back]

JACK: Er, excuse me. Excuse me. [Hands her his empty glass] Can I get another one of those, please?

STEWARDESS: I'm sorry, sir. We'll be landing in twenty minutes.

JACK: Well, twenty minutes is a long time.

STEWARDESS: [Hands him a newspaper] How about a newspaper instead? ...And if you could buckle your seatbelt, sir?

[She moves on]

STEWARDESS: Please fasten your seatbelt. Thank you.

[The plane shakes with turbulence. A tannoy bell sounds]

CAPTAIN: Sorry about the bumps, folks, we're just hitting a little warm air as we make our descent into Los Angeles. Please keep those seatbelts fastened and we'll have you on the ground shortly.

[Jack looks at the newspaper and notices something which seems to upset him. He rips out part of the paper]

[Jack drives over a bridge and stops on the side. He looks at the paper clipping and cries with his head on the steering wheel. He gets out his phone and dials]

VOICEMAIL: You've reached three one zero five five five zero one four eight. Please leave a message.

JACK: Hey. It's me. I, er, I just read... [hangs up]

[Jack steps out of the car and climbs up a ledge on the side of the bridge, looking over to a steep drop to solid concrete. He takes a deep breath]

JACK: Oh, forgive me.

[At that moment, sounds of a swerving car can be heard behind him, and a loud collision and smashed glass. The light of a fire brightens Jack's face, and a honk beeps continuously]

KID: Mom! Mom! Mom!

MOTHER: Help!!!

KID: Mom!

[Jack heads towards the incident]

[In real-time, the beach camp are all set to leave. Jack nods to Kate, who then looks at Sawyer with a long face. Jack heads to see Sayid]

JACK: You have everything you need?

SAYID: No, but I made the best out of what we have.

JACK: Bernard and Jin?

[They watch Bernard load a gun, while Jin speaks with Sun]

SAYID: They're both excellent shots...and highly motivated. The dynamite's in place. We won't miss. Jack, no matter what happens here, I want you to keep moving; keep moving for that radio tower. Don't turn back for any reason. I'm willing to give my life if it means securing rescue, but I'm not giving it up for nothing. You understand?

JACK: [Nods] Yeah. I understand.

[They shake hands]

SAYID: And good luck.

JACK: You too.

[Rose prepares to leave and heads over to Bernard]

ROSE: If I told you that I'd help you with your SOS sign, would you change your mind?

BERNARD: No ma'am.

ROSE: Then I want you to say it again.

BERNARD: Rose...

ROSE: Say it, Bernard.

BERNARD: I am a dentist. I am not Rambo.

ROSE: And don't you forget it.

[They hug]

[Rousseau watches Hurley as he holds Aaron, smiling]

HURLEY: Charlie's gonna be fine.

CLAIRE: Yeah. 'Course he is.

[Jin intimately speaks with Sun]

JIN: [Subtitle: Stay close to Jack, and rest if you feel tired.]

SUN: [Subtitle: Why are you doing this?]

JIN: [Subtitle: Because...we have to go home.]

[Sun cries and they kiss, Juliet watches further away stood with Naomi]

JACK: [To the group as a whole] All right. Let's do it.

[Rousseau leads on as almost the entire camp start following. Sayid, Bernard and Jin stand by themselves further away]

[Rousseau leads the survivors along the shoreline]

NAOMI: Jack. Can I ask you a question?

JACK: Sure.

NAOMI: What did you do for a living before you became Moses?

JACK: [Laughs] I was a doctor.

NAOMI: Right, course you were. Well, I need your attention for a minute, doctor.

[Naomi looks at Juliet, who has stopped with Jack]

NAOMI: [To Jack] Is she OK?

JACK: Why wouldn't she be?

NAOMI: Because none of your people trusts her. No offense.

JULIET: [To Jack] You know what why don't you catch up to me when you're done.

JACK: Juliet...

JULIET: It's fine.

[She moves on]

NAOMI: [Pulls out her phone] So, I need to show you how this wonderful gadget works in case anything happens to me. You need to be able to call my boat.

JACK: OK. Show me.

NAOMI: It's actually simple. You turn her on here. This opens a direct channel to the freighter. Give her a tap here. Wait for the beep, and say hello.

JACK: And that's it?

NAOMI: That's it. Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption's jamming us up, this red light will turn a lovely shade of green. That'll be any time now, yeah?

JACK: Hopefully.

[In The Looking Glass station, the blonde woman hits a tied-up Charlie]

BLONDE WOMAN: Who are you?

BRUNETTE WOMAN: Look, if you tell us how you got down here, we won't hurt you.

CHARLIE: I came in my invisible submarine. Don't you see it?

[The blonde woman hits Charlie again]

BRUNETTE WOMAN: Hey! Take it easy.

BLONDE WOMAN: Take it easy? He's one of them. Why are you here, huh? How did you find out about this station?

CHARLIE: Juliet told us. She's one of us now. In case you haven't heard.

[The blonde woman hits Charlie again]

BRUNETTE WOMAN: Stop. We gotta call Ben.

CHARLIE: Oh yeah. Let's call Ben.

BLONDE WOMAN: Come on.

[The two women go into a small communications room. Charlie watches and remembers Desmond's words]

DESMOND: You're inside a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light, above a switch...

[Charlie sees the light in the room]

DESMOND: ... You flick the switch, light goes off. Then you drown.

[At the Others camp, Ben is writing in his diary when he receives a transmission on his walkie]

BLONDE WOMAN: Come in. Come in, Ben.

BEN: Hello?

BLONDE WOMAN: Ben, it's Bonnie. Ben, are you there? Can you hear me, Ben?

[Mikhail and Richard are playing chess, and notice Ben on his walkie outside for signal]

BEN: Why are you breaking radio silence?

BONNIE: One of them's down here.

BEN: I'm sorry, what?!

BONNIE: We have him tied up but he's here. One of them swam down here.

BEN: Who? Which one?

BONNIE: He won't tell us.

CHARLIE: [Overhearing] It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi!

BEN: How did... how does he know about the station?

BONNIE: He said Juliet told them.

[Pause]

BEN: All right, sit tight, don't do anything, I'm sending help. [To Mikhail] Mikhail you need to go down to The Looking Glass and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there.

MIKHAIL: You told us The Looking Glass was inoperable. Flooded.

BEN: I lied. Mikhail, I need you to go now.

MIKHAIL: I can be there by dawn. But if Juliet told them about The Looking Glass, what else did she tell them?

[Mikhail goes, as Ben fiddles with his walkie]

BEN: Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there?

[At the beach, Ryan's walkie is off as he looks at the quiet camp with binoculars]

RYAN: Your walkies all off?

TOM: Yes sir.

[A female Other approaches]

RYAN: Did you get a good look?

FEMALE OTHER: The tents are marked with white coral, three of 'em. Juliet did her job.

RYAN: All right, let's do this.

[The Others advance as a unit, and fan out to the three tents. Sayid, Bernard and Jin are all at their vantage points waiting. Sayid waits until the Others literally pull back the sheets inside his marked tent]

FEMALE OTHER: It's empty!

RYAN: Get away from the tent!

[Sayid fires, and the tent explodes, knocking down at least three Others]

RYAN: It's a trap! Move!

BERNARD: Please, God.

[Bernard fires, and at least another two Others are thrown across the beach by the explosion. Jin aims and fires his short barreled handgun, but misses the dynamite. He fires again, but still misses]

MALE OTHER: Tree line!

[Jin is shot at numerous times. He counters and shoots two of them down. He crawls out from his vantage point but is knocked down by the blunt end of Ryan's shotgun]

RYAN: I got your man! Drop your weapons!

[Bernard runs for the jungle, but is clotheslined by Tom, and kicked unconscious]

RYAN: I got your man!

[Sayid has his sniper scope dead on Ryan as he approaches with his gun at Jin's head]

RYAN: It's over!

[Sayid prepares to pull the trigger but feels another gun against his own head. Another male Other has survived the attack]

MALE OTHER: Don't. Finger off the trigger.

[Sayid does so]

[Miles away, the main group watch the smoke rise from the beach.

ROSE: There were supposed to be THREE explosions.

KATE: [To Jack] It didn't work.

[Cut to Jack in a hospital]

TANNOY: Doctor Leon to surgery, Doctor Leon to surgery.

[Jack is having stitches put in on a cut on his forehead by a female doctor]

DOCTOR: There you go. Good as new.

JACK: Thanks.

DOCTOR: The news people are waiting for you outside. You being a hero and all.

JACK: Right. The woman, how is she?

DOCTOR: She's been stabilized. Thank god you were on that bridge.

JACK: Right.

[Sarah Shephard enters]

DOCTOR: Sorry, no visitors in ER.

JACK: It's OK. She... we used to be married.

DOCTOR: Come on in.

[The doctor leaves]

SARAH: What happened?

JACK: We saw... a car accident.

SARAH: Are you OK?

JACK: Yeah. Yeah I'm fine.

SARAH: Are you drinking again?

JACK: No.

SARAH: Are you, Jack?

JACK: No. Why did you come down here, Sarah?

SARAH: Erm, I'm still your emergency contact. What were you doing driving around at two o'clock in the morning?

[Pause]

JACK: You think maybe you could give me a lift home?

SARAH: I don't think that would be appropriate.

JACK: Well, thanks for coming down, Sarah.

SARAH: Goodbye, Jack.

[She leaves]

[In real-time, Jack continues to watch with the rest of the group the smoke rising from the beach]

SUN: Why were there only two explosions?

JACK: Maybe they didn't have to blow the third tent.

ROSE: But those gunshots, what was that all...

JACK: He's OK, Rose.

SUN: Do you believe that?

JACK: Listen, they had no idea that we were waiting for them. And Sayid's with your husbands, they're gonna be fine and they're gonna be a couple of hours behind us.

SUN: Then we should wait for them here. You go on...

JACK: No. No-one gets left behind.

ROSE: If you say live together die alone to me Jack, I'm gonna punch you in your face.

JACK: [Laughs] Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough. [To the group] But we have a plan. And for all we know, it worked. It's gonna be OK, everything's gonna be all right. Let's just keep moving, OK?

[They do so]

SUN: [To Rose] It's OK, let's go.

[Naomi looks at her phone, which is still beeping red]

[At The Looking Glass, Bonnie and the brunette woman continue to question Charlie]

BONNIE: I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here?

CHARLIE: I'm here, to turn off your jamming equipment. It's in there, next to the flashing yellow light.

BRUNETTE WOMAN: How do you know about that?

CHARLIE: I know, because I know. Whatever you ladies do to me, I'm going to turn it off.

BONNIE: You are, huh?

CHARLIE: Most definitely am.

BONNIE: So what's the code?

CHARLIE: What?

BONNIE: Oh Charlie if you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment you're gonna need the code. And only three people know it. Me, her, and Ben.

CHARLIE: Well, guess I won't need the code. Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway. I just turn off your little jammer and the helicopters come and rescue all my friends.

BONNIE: But if this station floods, what happens to you.

CHARLIE: I die.

[Ben uses his walkie at the Others' camp]

BEN: What?

TOM: They're all dead. Diane, Ivan, all of em, dead. And Shephard and his people, they're all gone.

BEN: Gone, gone where?

TOM: I dunno. Did you hear me? They killed seven of our...

RYAN: Tom! Calm down and tell him the good news.

BEN: What good news?

TOM: We caught three of em. The one's who stayed behind to blow up the tents. Ben, they knew we were coming?

BEN: It was Juliet. She betrayed us.

TOM: What?

BEN: Just figure out where she is, Tom.

RYAN: [To Sayid] Get up.

[He pulls him up]

RYAN: OK, junior, where the hell did...

[Sayid spits in his face, and Ryan hits him hard over the head with his handgun]

TOM: They're not talking.

BEN: Who do you have?

TOM: Jarrah, Kwon, and the dentist.

BEN: Shoot Kwon.

TOM: What?

BEN: If you want them to answer questions, kill Kwon, do it now.

JIN: [Speaks Korean at Tom]

RYAN: I dunno what that means, but I'm sure it's lovely.

[He cocks his gun]

BERNARD: No, wait. No.

JIN: No. No talk.

BERNARD: No please.

TOM: You talk to me, nobody will get hurt. Now tell me where your people are.

SAYID: He's lying, he's going to kill us all any...

[Sayid is kicked down]

RYAN: Where are they?

[Short pause. Ryan puts his gun at Jin]

RYAN: Sayonara.

BERNARD: A radio tower. They're hiking to a radio tower.

TOM: Why in the hell are they going there?

BERNARD: A woman, parachuted here. She has a satellite phone and they're gonna call her ship.

BEN: [On walkie] Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow. So why were they waiting for us tonight?

RYAN: [To Bernard] You heard him. How'd you know?

BERNARD: A kid, told us, he came in a canoe, and he warned us.

TOM: What kid?

BERNARD: Karl. He said his name was Karl.

TOM: You heard that, Ben? [Pause] Ben?!

BEN: I heard.

[Ben looks out of his tent and stares at Alex]

TOM: What d'you want us to do, kill em?

BEN: No. Not yet.

[In the morning, Ben draws a line to the radio tower on a map, as Richard watches]

RICHARD: We're going to the radio tower?

BEN: Not we, Richard, me. You're going to take everyone to the Temple as planned.

RICHARD: Now might not be the best time to go tromping off on your own.

BEN: Oh really and why not?

RICHARD: Because people are asking questions, Ben. About leaving home, about what happened to Locke, about Jacob. Not to mention the rapidly spreading rumour that everyone that went down to the beach is dead.

BEN: They're not all dead.

[Ben gets up to get some things]

ALEX: Where are you going?

BEN: Hello, Alex.

ALEX: I asked where you were going.

BEN: Well I thought I might go for a walk! See if I can't find Jack and all his friends.

ALEX: [Defiantly] I'm coming with you.

BEN: All right.

ALEX: [Surprised] What?

BEN: I said all right. In fact I think it's a good idea. I mean you do want to see Karl again, don't you? [Pause] Get your pack, I'm leaving in ten minutes.

RICHARD: There's forty of them. And you're alone. They're gonna do whatever it takes to get off the Island. What do you think's gonna happen when you get there?

BEN: I'm gonna talk them out of it.

[In the jungle, the group have stopped to collect some water from a stream. Rose and Sun share anxious looks. Kate goes to speak with Sawyer]

KATE: Something's wrong.

SAWYER: Lots of things are wrong, Kate.

KATE: Jin, Bernard and Sayid, they should have caught up to us by now. I wanna go back to make sure they're all right.

SAWYER: Course you do.

KATE: What's that supposed to mean?

SAWYER: It means, Kate, there's always someone to go back for.

KATE: What's the matter with you?

SAWYER: Nothing.

KATE: [Sarcastically] Nothing?

SAWYER: I'm fine.

KATE: Why don't you just tell me what happened?

[Sawyer pauses, and Kate splashes him with water from the stream]

SAWYER: What you do that for?

KATE: To wake you up. Ever since you got that tape from Locke it's like you've been sleepwalking. You don't care about our friends, fine, but it's like you don't care about anything anymore. And since when did you start calling me Kate?

[Sawyer starts to go]

KATE: You know. They sent Juliet to check out Sun, but she was there to check and see if I'm pregnant too.

SAWYER: Well let's hope you're not.

[Sawyer goes, giving Jack a brief look. Jack walks over to Naomi who is holding the satellite phone]

JACK: The light's still red?

[Naomi nods]

[Out on the canoe, Desmond wakes up slowly. He looks over the edge where Charlie dove down. Suddenly, he takes cover as he is attacked by gunfire. On the shore, Mikhail is shooting at him at range. Desmond dives down to escape the bullets, and swims up into the moon pool at the station. Inside, Bonnie and the brunette woman are arguing in the comms room with the door closed as Desmond emerges from the water]

CHARLIE: Des. Des!

DESMOND: Charlie! Bloody hell! You all right?

CHARLIE: Not for long if you don't get out of here. You have to hide, Des, hide, hide, there's people in there! Quick, hide hide hide. Go go go! Hide hide hide.

[The women hear him]

BONNIE: Who's he talking to?

CHARLIE: [Singing] I feel like standing.... stupid people....

BONNIE: Who are you talking to?

CHARLIE: I wasn't talking to anyone, I was just singing. [Sings] You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody!

[Bonnie hits Charlie across the face]

BONNIE: Shut up.

CHARLIE: Right, OK, you got it.

BONNIE: [To brunette woman] Come on.

[They go back into the comms room. Charlie looks over. Desmond is hiding in a locker/behind a door nearby]

[Cut to Jack in the hospital. Jack stands at the foot of a patient's bed looking at their chart. His hand shakes, and he takes a pill as a male doctor enters]

MALE DOCTOR: Can I help you?

JACK: Just checking her chart.

MALE DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm Doctor Hamill, Rob. The new chief of surgery, I don't think we've met yet.

JACK: Jack Shephard.

DR. HAMILL: Doctor Shephard, the hero. Twice over.

[He gestures his hand to shake, and Jack reluctantly does so]

DR. HAMILL: You all right? After last night I'm surprised that you'd even want to come in. Talk about right place right time, huh? This woman is very lucky you were there.

JACK: If she was lucky she wouldn't have a fractured back that was impinging on her spinal cord. I'd like to operate first thing in the morning.

DR. HAMILL: You wanna operate?

JACK: Yes.

DR. HAMILL: I'm sorry, Jack, but this isn't your patient. And we are well aware of the issues, Gary Nadler is doing the surgery at six AM.

JACK: [Pauses] With all due respect, Doctor Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.

DR. HAMILL: Jack. Last night you pulled this woman's eight year old son out of a burning car then you went back for her. I think you've done enough.

JACK: I wanna do the surgery.

DR. HAMILL: Look. Everything's under control. She'll be fine. Go home, have a drink. You deserve it.

[He pauses]

DR. HAMILL: The chart please, Jack.

[Jack also pauses then gives him it]

JACK: You call me. I wanna know what happens.

[Jack walks down the ward to see the news on a television]

REPORTER: This morning... [inaudible]... bridge was shut down for several hours in the wake of a fiery car accident that left two injured, an unidentified forty year old woman and her son...

[The child is by the TV, and waves to Jack from his seat, and Jack gestures back kindly]

REPORTER: ...Fortunately for the two of them, Doctor Jack Shephard, who was at the scene of the crash, pulled both victims from the burning wreckage and treated them at the scene until paramedics arrived. The victims were later transported to Saint Sebastian Hospital. Further details of their conditions have not yet been....

[In real-time, the group continues to walk to the tower]

SAWYER: I'm going back.

JACK: What?

SAWYER: I'm going back to the beach.

JACK: No way. We keep moving.

SAWYER: I ain't asking permission.

[Juliet and Kate both stop also]

SAWYER: [To Jack] Look you got a job to do here. I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it. And you sure as hell don't need me.

JACK: What do you think you're gonna get done. Alone and unarmed.

KATE: He won't be alone, I'll go with him.

SAWYER: No!

KATE: Twenty minutes ago you weren't even interested in going, and now all of a sudden you're telling Jack I'm...

SAWYER: I didn't wanna go with you.

JACK: Sawyer, it's a suicide mission without guns.

JULIET: I know where there are some guns. There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here. I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.

JACK: Juliet, you don't have to do that.

JULIET: Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.

SAWYER: Let's do this.

[Sawyer goes]

JACK: [To Juliet] Don't do anything stupid.

JULIET: I won't if you won't.

[She kisses him, Kate watches]

JULIET: Don't wait up.

[She leaves, and Jack sees that Kate was watching]

[At the underwater station, Charlie hums while Desmond still hides]

CHARLIE: [Sings and hums inaudibly]

BONNIE: AH!! I told you to shut up!!!

CHARLIE: You know when you get a tune stuck, in your head? This song just started coming to me, it's almost finished. Just need to find the bridge. [Hums and sings inaudibly again]

BONNIE: Get the speargun!

BRUNETTE WOMAN: What, why?

BONNIE: Cause I want it to hurt.

BRUNETTE WOMAN: No, Ben said...

BONNIE: You don't wanna get it, I will.

[Bonnie heads to where Desmond is hiding]

BRUNETTE WOMAN: Bonnie.

CHARLIE: Oi, oi oi, no! I'll, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up.

[Mikhail suddenly emerges from the water with diving gear]

BONNIE: Mikhail?

MIKHAIL: I thought you two were on assignment in Canada?

BRUNETTE WOMAN: He made us promise not to tell anyone.

CHARLIE: Hello again.

MIKHAIL: Where is the other one?

BONNIE: What?

MIKHAIL: This idiot swam down from a boat. I was just shooting at his friend. He dove down here.

BONNIE: He's alone.

MIKHAIL: Are you sure about that?

[Mikhail approaches Charlie with a knife]

CHARLIE: Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops. Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't. Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the Island.

MIKHAIL: What? Is that true?

[A bleeping sound can be heard from the comms room]

BRUNETTE WOMAN: That's Ben.

MIKHAIL: [Holds up his knife] I'll get it.

[In the jungle, Ben talks to Mikhail on his walkie as he and Alex walk]

BEN: You have to understand, everything I did, I did for the Island.

MIKHAIL: The Island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people?

BEN: Yes it did. You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail, now I'm asking you to trust me, to trust Jacob who told me to do this.

MIKHAIL: Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people?

BEN: Because this Island is under assault by forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many many years. And we are meant to protect it, Mikhail, by any means necessary. The jamming was for everyone's security. We are in a serious situation here.

MIKHAIL: So why not trust me?

BEN: I made a mistake. I should have told you, and I apologize.

[Pause]

BEN: Mikhail, are you still there?

MIKHAIL: Yes.

BEN: I need you to help me. I need you to help me clean up this mess I've made. I need you to kill Charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all costs. And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others about what we've done, so you'll have to take care of them too.

[Alex looks shocked]

MIKHAIL: How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me

BEN: Because if I had, Mikhail, you'd already be dead.

[Mikhail thinks]

[Out in the jungle, Juliet and Sawyer head for the beach]

SAWYER: So, when you pulled us out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang, what the hell you have us breaking all those rocks for anyway?

JULIET: We were building a runway.

SAWYER: Runway, for what?

JULIET: [Turns to him] The aliens.

[She smirks]

JULIET: I don't know what for, do you think they told me everything?

SAWYER: Yeah yeah, whatever you say. So you screwing Jack yet?

JULIET: No. Are you?

[Sawyer chuckles]

SAWYER: How far away are these guns.

JULIET: There aren't any guns.

[Sawyer grabs her]

SAWYER: What?

JULIET: I lied.

SAWYER: You lied?

JULIET: It was the only way he'd let us go back.

SAWYER: So why are you going back?

JULIET: Karma. Why are you going back, James?

HURLEY: Hey! Hey guys, wait up!

[Hurley emerges from the brush]

SAWYER: What the hell do you want?

HURLEY: I'm coming with you guys.

SAWYER: Uh uh, no way. Not a chance.

HURLEY: Come on, I can help. They're my friends too, man. Look, Charlie wouldn't let me go with him, Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me. I just wanna help, please?

SAWYER: For God's sake, Hugo, look at you. You're just gonna get in the way. You wanna get us killed? [To Juliet] Come on!

[Sawyer leaves, and Juliet reluctantly follows, leaving Hurley abashed]

[Further away, Ben and Alex have stopped while Ben studies his map]

BEN: If we head North, we should get to em before they reach the tower.

ALEX: Why did you let me come?

BEN: I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family. I let you come because you betrayed me, Alex.

ALEX: You locked Karl in a cage. You put him in a room and tried to brainwash him.

BEN: I didn't want him to get you pregnant. I suppose I overreacted. We better get going.

ALEX: Ben. Why do you have to stop them? Why won't you just let them leave.

BEN: Because I can't, Alex.

[They carry on]

[At the DHARMA mass grave, Locke opens his eyes. He moves his legs with his arms, and sees a gun on one of the skeletons. He drags himself to it barely, and checks it to see it has bullets in. He prepares to shoot himself in the head, amidst whispers]

VOICE: Don't, John.

[John looks suddenly to see Walt stood over the grave]

WALT: Put the gun down.

LOCKE: Walt!

WALT: Now get up, John.

LOCKE: He shot me and I can't, move my legs.

WALT: You can move your legs. Now get out of the ditch, John.

LOCKE: Why?

WALT: Because, you have work to do.

[Locke smiles]

[The team continue to trek as Jack approaches Kate]

JACK: You OK?

KATE: Yeah, I just, had a rock in my shoe.

[Pause]

JACK: He didn't mean it, you know.

KATE: What?

JACK: Sawyer. When he said that he didn't want you to go with him, he didn't mean it.

KATE: He didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

JACK: I'm trying to protect you. That's why I asked you not to come back for me.

[He starts to go]

KATE: Hey. Why are you sticking up for Sawyer, he'd never do it for you.

JACK: Because I love you.

[Jack walks on, as does Kate after a moments reflection]

[Cut to Jack driving his car and looking at the newspaper clipping. He stops, and dials on his phone]

VOICEMAIL: You have reached three one zero five five five zero...

[Jack hangs up and exits his car, stepping right out into the road and almost getting run down. He enters a funeral parlor, where a closed casket is on display, and seats lined up with no-one there. The funeral director enters the room]

DIRECTOR: Can I help you?

JACK: Sorry I er. Actually I came, er, is the funeral over?

DIRECTOR: There was no funeral, sir, only a viewing. Nobody showed up.

JACK: Nobody? You sure?

DIRECTOR: Just you. [Rather disinterestedly] My deepest condolences. Friend or family?

JACK: Neither.

DIRECTOR: Would you like me to open it up?

JACK: No.

DIRECTOR: Take your time.

[Jack goes over to the casket and places his hand on it, tears in his eyes. He gets a pack of pills from his pocket, and notices he only has one left]

JACK: [Mutters] Damn it.

[He takes the pill, and leaves]

[In real-time, Jack catches up to Rousseau on their trek]

JACK: Danielle. How much further?

ROUSSEAU: About an hour.

JACK: The radio tower, when was the last time you were there?

ROUSSEAU: The day I recorded the message. I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving here.

JACK: What?

ROUSSEAU: There's no place for me back there. This is my home now.

[As they walk, they see Ben and Alex stood right ahead of them. Everyone stops, Jack steps forward]

BEN: Hello, Jack. We need to talk.

[Inside The Looking Glass, Mikhail exits the comms room]

GRETA: What did Ben say?

BONNIE: Can we kill him?

MIKHAIL: Is it possible to turn this equipment off?

BONNIE: What?

MIKHAIL: The equipment that's jamming the Island, can you turn it off?

GRETA: Sure. Ben gave us the code.

MIKHAIL: You are the only ones who have it?

BONNIE: Yeah. Why?

MIKHAIL: What would happen if this station were to be flooded?

GRETA: Nothing. The casing for the equipment is waterproof, it'll keep going forever.

MIKHAIL: Then why do you need to be here?

BONNIE: Because Ben told us to. We were following orders.

MIKHAIL: And you never asked why?

BONNIE: No. Because I trust him. And I trust Jacob. And the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing, everything that we're doing here falls apart.

MIKHAIL: [To Greta] She makes an excellent point.

[He shoots Greta, who falls into the water. Bonnie runs, and Mikhail shoots her in the back. He kicks her over]

BONNIE: No, please.

MIKHAIL: I'm sorry, Bonnie, I too am following orders.

[Desmond emerges]

DESMOND: Hey!

[He shoots Mikhail with the speargun in the chest. Bonnie tries to grab his gun. Desmond gets it first and points it at her]

CHARLIE: No, Des, no, don't. We need her.

[Jack and Ben stand opposite each other inland. Kate heads off to take the flank, as Jack goes to Ben and circles him]

BEN: [To Naomi] Hi, I'm Benjamin, I don't believe we've had the pleasure...

JACK: Don't talk to him! [To Ben] What do you want?

BEN: Just a moment of your time. To talk, you and me, alone.

JACK: For what?

BEN: Jack you've just killed seven of my people, the least you can give me is five minutes.

[Rose and Sun exchange anxious looks. Kate arrives back to Jack]

JACK: He alone?

KATE: There's only two sets of tracks, his and hers.

JACK: Five minutes.

[Ben nods, as he leads on taking Jack away, Jack grabs Ben's walkie]

[Cut to Jack picking up a prescription]

PHARMACIST: I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.

JACK: Ah, that's a mistake. I er, I only refilled it twice, could you check again?

PHARMACIST: I did check it again Doctor Shephard, and that was the third refill so there's nothing I can do.

JACK: Fine. I've got another prescription right here.

MAN: Hey, I know you. You're the hero.

JACK: I'm not a hero.

MAN: Yeah yeah, we saw it on TV. Hey lady, what's wrong with you? Just give this guy whatever he needs. Do you know what he did?

JACK: Here it is, here. Oxycodone.

PHARMACIST: Doctor Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.

JACK: That's not me, that's Doctor Christian Shephard, I'm Doctor Jack Shephard, he's my father.

PHARMACIST: I'm gonna have to call your father's office to confirm this.

JACK: He's out of town right now.

PHARMACIST: Well I'm sure somebody in the office...

[Jack slams on the counter]

JACK: Don't bother.

[He leaves, knocking over a fixture as he goes]

[Jack follows Ben away from the main group]

BEN: Have a seat.

[Jack does so with Ben]

BEN: Not so long ago, Jack. I made a decision, that took the lives of over forty people in a single day. I'm telling you this because, history is about to repeat itself, right here, right now.

JACK: Let me guess, you've got us surrounded, and if I don't do what you say you're gonna, you're gonna kill all my people.

BEN: No Jack, you are.

[Jack laughs]

JACK: And how am I going to do that, Ben?

BEN: The woman you're travelling with. The one who parachuted onto the Island from that helicopter. She's not who she says she is.

JACK: She's not, huh?

BEN: No she's not.

JACK: Then who is she?

BEN: She's a representative of some people who've been trying to find this Island, Jack. She's one of the bad guys.

JACK: Oh, I almost forgot, you're the, you're the good guys.

BEN: Jack, listen to me. If you phone her boat, every single living person on this Island will be killed. So here's what has to happen. Get that device, the phone she carries with her, and give it me. I will turn around, we'll go back to my people, you will turn around and go back to your people.

JACK: I'm not going anywhere.

[They both stand confrontationally]

BEN: May I have my walkie back?

JACK: What?

BEN: There's something you need to hear. Please.

[Jack gives it him]

BEN: Tom, are you there?

TOM: Yes, I'm here.

BEN: [To Jack] Your plan killed seven of my people, but the one's that you failed to kill are now holding your friends. Jin, Sayid, Bernard. At gunpoint.

SAYID: Jack don't give him anything!!!

[Sounds of a struggle can be heard over the walkie]

BERNARD: Leave him alone!!

RYAN: I said shut up!!

[A thud signals Ryan hitting someone]

JACK: And what's to stop me from snapping your neck?

BEN: [Quickly] Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them.

TOM: Got it.

[Ben looks at his watch]

RYAN: I said don't move!!

BEN: Bring me the phone, Jack.

SAYID: Don't negotiate with him...

JIN: No!

BEN: Forty seconds.

JACK: No. I'm getting them all off the Island. All of them!!

BEN: Let me ask you something, Jack. Why do you wanna leave the Island? What is it that you so desperately want to get back to? You have no-one. Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's twenty seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack.

JACK: No.

BEN: Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.

JACK: No.

BEN: I'm not bluffing!

JACK: I WON'T DO IT!!!

BEN: Five. Four. Three...

JACK: No.

[Pause]

[Three shots sound over the mike]

BEN: I'm so sorry, Jack.

[Jack attacks Ben, hitting him numerous times and causing his own knuckles to bleed. He grabs the walkie]

JACK: Tom. Are you there?

TOM: Yeah, Jack, I hear you.

JACK: I'm going to lead my people up to the radio tower. And I'm gonna make a call. And I'm gonna get em all rescued, every one of them. And then I'm gonna come find you, and I'm gonna kill ya.

[At The Looking Glass, Charlie has been set free by Desmond]

CHARLIE: What's the code?

BONNIE: Go away.

CHARLIE: Bonnie, let's just get this over with, OK? What's the code?

DESMOND: She's not gonna tell you, brother.

CHARLIE: Yeah she's gonna tell me.

DESMOND: What makes you say that?

CHARLIE: Because you said it's my destiny to turn off that jammer. OK, Bonnie, we're both gonna die down here. All right, let's be perfectly honest. A one-eyed maniac just killed your friend, he shot you in the back. It would appear that your glorious leader, Ben, put him up to it. Are you a sodding idiot? You have the opportunity to make Ben very very angry. Why would you not take that?

BONNIE: Five, four, five...

CHARLIE: What?

BONNIE: Eight, seven, sev-...

CHARLIE: Is that the code?

BONNIE: Five, five, four, three, seven, seven...

CHARLIE: Start again.

BONNIE: Six, one.

CHARLIE: Stop, Bonnie. Start from the beginning, start again. Bonnie, Bonnie! Wake up, stop. Bonnie, start again.

BONNIE: Good vibrations.

CHARLIE: What?

BONNIE: Beach boys. Good vibrations. On the keypad, the numbers, they're notes. It was programmed by a musician.

[Bonnie loses consciousness. Charlie and Desmond exchange looks]

[Inland, Jack drags a bloody Ben back to the main group, and throws him on the ground]

JACK: Tie him up. He's coming with us.

[Jack walks on and Kate chases after him. Alex approaches Ben, and Danielle approaches Alex]

ALEX: What?

BEN: [Sighs] Alex. This is your mother.

[They stare at each other, Rousseau holding back tears]

ROUSSEAU: I'll help you tie him up.

[Kate catches up to Jack]

KATE: What happened? What he say?

JACK: It's not important right now. Just, get everything together...

KATE: Jack. Your knuckles. Here.

[Kate cleans them for him]

KATE: What happened?

JACK: He killed them. Bernard, Jin, Sayid, all three of them. He radioed the beach. And I let it happen. I had to let it happen. We can't tell Rose, or Sun, not yet. We gotta keep moving, I promised Sayid, that we would keep moving.

KATE: So why did you bring him back? Why didn't you just kill him?

JACK: Because I want him to see it. I want him to experience the moment that we get off this Island, and I want him to know that he failed. And then I'll kill him.

[At the beach, Ryan and Tom argue as they walk]

RYAN: It was an order, Tom, we had to follow it.

TOM: Ben doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, he's lost it! I mean look at what they did to us. Instead of putting three bullets in the damned sand, we should have killed them for real.

[Sayid, Jin and Bernard are still tied up with a third Other pointing his gun at them]

[Further away, Juliet and Sawyer observe]

SAWYER: All they got left is three guys and four guns.

JULIET: And all we've got, James, are two people and no guns.

SAWYER: So we'll wait till night.

JULIET: That isn't going to change the fact that we're unarmed, if you wanna kill yourself, fine, but before you go I can try...

SAWYER: Shh! You hear that?

[They turn to see the DHARMA van drive right by them. Hurley drives it through a tent and straight towards Ryan and Tom. Tom dives out of the way while Ryan fires at Hurley. He misses, however, and Hurley ploughs right into him]

MALE OTHER: Ryan!!!

[Hurley brakes and prepares to get out of the van. Sawyer pushes the car door back shut]

HURLEY: Woo!

SAWYER: Stay in the bus, Hugo.

[Sawyer grabs Ryan's gun off the ground, and jumps out round the front at the male Other. Sayid kicks him, knocking him down before he can fire at Sawyer. Sayid then wraps his legs round his neck, breaking it before Sawyer shoots. Jin, Bernard and Sawyer all look with surprise, as Sayid nods to Sawyer. Tom crawls to another gun on the ground, but Juliet grabs it and steps on his hand, causing him to cry out with pain]

JULIET: [Points the gun at him] Stay right there, Tom.

TOM: [Turns to Sawyer] OK. I give up.

[Sawyer pauses, then shoots him in the chest, surprising Juliet]

SAWYER: That's for taking the kid off the raft.

HURLEY: Dude it was over, he surrendered.

SAWYER: I didn't believe him.

[Cut to Jack in a hospital]

[Jack raids a medicine cabinet, and gets some oxycodone. He takes some, and pockets more. He then leaves, but knocks over files]

DR. HAMILL: What are you doing, Doctor Shephard?

[Jack turns to see Hamill at the door]

JACK: I was just er, I just just checking the er, the Arland charts. Just wanted to, just wanted to see how the operation went.

DR. HAMILL: I left three messages on your voice mail, you didn't get them?

JACK: My phone's broken.

DR. HAMILL: Let's go to my office, Jack.

JACK: For what?

DR. HAMILL: We need to have a talk. Come on.

JACK: You know, I know that you're, you're new around here, so you don't know much about...

DR. HAMILL: I know enough. But let's just walk down to my office...

JACK: If you've got something to say to me, you can say it to me, right here.

DR. HAMILL: [To a nurse] Will you excuse us, please?

[The nurse leaves]

DR. HAMILL: Mrs Arland, the woman you saved, woke up in recovery about two hours ago. She was in some pain but highly responsive to the reflex test and entirely lucid.

JACK: That's... that's great.

DR. HAMILL: But then she described the series of events that caused her accident. She says she was driving over the bridge when she saw man standing on top of the railing, about to jump off. She was distracted, lost control of her car. She ran into the median, rolled over and was hit by the van behind her. So the obvious question here, Jack, is how did you get to that flaming car so fast? What were you doing on that bridge?

JACK: Do you know how many years I've worked at this hospital? Do you know anything about me? Do you have any idea what I've been through?

DR. HAMILL: How much have you had to drink today, Jack?

JACK: OK, I'll tell you what, you do this. You get my father down here, get him down here right now, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me. [Pause] Don't you look at me like that. Don't you, pity me.

DR. HAMILL: I'm trying to help you.

JACK: You can't help me!!

[Everyone in the ward stares. Jack walks away]

[Out in the jungle, Jack leads the group with Rousseau toward the tower. Ben's walkie which he carries suddenly springs to life]

HURLEY: Attention, Others. Come in, Others. If you're listening in, I want you to know that we got you bastards. And, unless the rest of you wanna be blown up, you best stay away from our beach...

[Everyone stops and listens]

JACK: Hurley?

HURLEY: Jack?

JACK: Where are you, what's going on?

HURLEY: Dude. I'm back at the beach.

JACK: What?

HURLEY: Yeah I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer I, I saved them.

JACK: They're OK, Juliet and...

HURLEY: Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard. We're all...

JACK: What, wait. Bernard and Jin and Sayid, they're with you?!

HURLEY: Yeah dude, I told you, I saved em all.

[Everyone shouts with relief and hug, and Rose and Sun hug notably]

JACK: Hey, stay where you are, we're almost up to the tower. You'll be safer there.

HURLEY: Yeah I got ya, we'll stay put until you like, phone home.

[Everyone continues to cry happily as Claire steps forward]

CLAIRE: [Into the walkie] What about Charlie, did he make it back yet?

HURLEY: Not yet, but they're probably paddling home as we speak. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.

[Hurley looks out at an empty sea]

CHARLIE: Des? There's diving gear in those racks, yeah?

DESMOND: Aye. There's plenty.

CHARLIE: Why don't you take care of that, I'll tap out "Good Vibrations."

DESMOND: All right, mate.

CHARLIE: Hey, Des.

DESMOND: Aye?

CHARLIE: You get any flashes?

DESMOND: No, nuttin.

CHARLIE: Meet you back here then.

DESMOND: Aye.

[Charlie heads to the communication room and enters the code by entering numbers corresponding to the notes to the song. When he finishes, the yellow light goes out, and an engine of some kind seems to start up]

CHARLIE: So much for fate.

[As he leaves, a noise calls him back, a flat beep sound. A button is flashing, and Charlie reads the text under it]

CHARLIE: Incoming transmission!

[He quickly presses it, and Penelope Widmore appears on the view-screen]

PENNY: Hello?! Can you hear me?

CHARLIE: Yes, yes I can hear you.

PENNY: Who is this? Who am I speaking to?

CHARLIE: Charlie er... Charlie Pace, I'm a survivor of Flight eight-one-five, Oceanic Flight eight-one-five.

PENNY: Er... where are you?

CHARLIE: We're on an Island, we're alive.

PENNY: An Island!! Well where, what's your location?

CHARLIE: I dunno. Who's this?

PENNY: This is Penelope. Penelope Widmore. How did you get this frequency?

CHARLIE: [Shouts] Desmond? Desmond!

PENNY: Did you just say Desmond?

CHARLIE: Yeah, he's here, he's with me.

PENNY: [Smiles] Is he OK?

CHARLIE: He's brilliant! Hey, are you on the boat?

PENNY: What, what boat?

CHARLIE: Your boat, eighty miles off shore. Er... Naomi, parachutist.

PENNY: But, I'm not on a boat, who, who's Naomi?

[Desmond looks around the moon pool room, and notices Mikhail's body is missing. In the comms room, a tap at the window cause Charlie to turn. Mikhail is outside in the water, with a grenade in his hand]

PENNY: Hello, hello is Desmond there? Desmond, can you hear me? Desmond?

[Mikhail pulls the cork. Charlie turns to see Desmond running toward the room, and he rushes to close the door. As he does so, Desmond sees the video screen]

PENNY: Can you hear me?

DESMOND: Penny!!! No...

[Charlie closes the door and locks it. Mikhail lets off the grenade and the window is destroyed. Water rushes into the comms room]

DESMOND: Charlie!!!

[Charlie turns to the water as Desmond hammers against the door with a fire extinguisher. Charlie stands still then suddenly rushes, grabbing a pen from his pocket and writing on his hand desperately. He then dives down to the door window between him and Desmond, pressing his hand on the glass with the words “Not Penny's boat”. Desmond understands, and Charlie smiles. Charlie then breathes in, and he rushes backwards in the water. As he drowns, he gestures the cross on his chest]

[Out in the jungle, Aaron begins to cry in Claire's arms]

CLAIRE: Sshh. hey Aaron, it's OK, sweetie.

NAOMI: What's the matter?

CLAIRE: I dunno, I think he's just a bit scared.

NAOMI: Hard to blame him.

[Naomi's phone beeps. She looks at it, and the light is beeping green]

CLAIRE: What is it?

NAOMI: What's your boyfriend's name? The rock star who swam down to the station?

CLAIRE: Charlie, why?

NAOMI: Charlie just got us rescued.

[Naomi runs up the line of trekkers]

NAOMI: Jack!! Jack, he did it!! Your friend bloody well did it!

JACK: What?

NAOMI: The green light, it's on. The jamming's stopped.

JACK: Use it then.

NAOMI: All right.

[She dials]

VOICE: Four, four, two..

FEMALE VOICE: [Speaks in French]

NAOMI: What's this?

JACK: It's Rousseau's message, it's still blocking the signal.

ROUSSEAU: It doesn't matter. We're here.

VOICE: [On phone] Iteration one, seven, five...

[The group trek up a hill to see the radio tower dominating the sky. Inside the French message can be heard playing on loop. The recording is from a machine in the room by a speaker]

ROUSSEAU: I recorded this sixteen years ago. [To Alex] Three days before you were born. I guess we don't need it anymore.

[She turns off the recording and removes the tape]

JACK: [To Naomi] All right, do it.

[Naomi holds the phone]

NAOMI: I can't get a signal in here.

[They all exit the room and go outside, as everyone watches, including Ben who has been tied to a tree]

NAOMI: I'm getting something!

KATE: It's gonna work! It's happening, we're gonna get off of this Island!

JACK: We'll celebrate when we're home.

BEN: Jack! I know you think you're saying your people. But you need to stop this. It's a mistake.

JACK: The mistake was listening to you.

BEN: This'll be your last chance, Jack. I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end.

NAOMI: I've got it, I've got a signal!!!

BEN: Jack please, you don't know what you're doing!!

JACK: I know exactly what I'm doing.

[Naomi presses on the phone, and it says “CONNECTED”. Naomi suddenly shakes, and spurts blood from her mouth. She falls down with a knife in her back and drops the phone. Behind her, Locke moves forward]

JACK: JOHN!!!

[Locke pulls out the gun he found, and points it at Jack]

LOCKE: Step back, Jack.

JACK: What did you do?

LOCKE: What I had to. Now step back.

[Jack stays still as the phone tone signals that Naomi has made the call, and there just needs someone to answer it]

LOCKE: Stay away from the phone.

[Jack dives for it. Locke tries to destroy it, but his shot misses and Jack takes it]

JACK: What are you doing, John?

LOCKE: I don't wanna shoot you.

BEN: Do it, John! Shoot him! Do what you need to do...

[Rousseau knocks him unconscious with an elbow strike to the face. The phone continues to beep waiting for someone to pick up]

LOCKE: Please. Put the phone down.

JACK: No. You're done keeping me on this Island.

[Locke cocks the barrel]

LOCKE: I will kill you if I have to.

JACK: Then do it, John.

KATE: Jack.

[Locke pauses, and then lowers the gun]

LOCKE: Jack. You're not supposed to do this.

[The phone is answered]

MAN: Minkowski. Hello?

[Jack puts it to his ear]

JACK: Who is this?

MINKOWSKI: Who is this?

JACK: My name is Jack Shephard. Are you, are you on the boat, the freighter?

MINKOWSKI: How'd you get this channel?

[Locke can be seen leaving the area]

JACK: Naomi, Naomi told us about your search team. About the boat.

MINKOWSKI: Naomi. You found her? Where is she? Who are you?

JACK: I'm one of the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. Can you get a fix on our location?

MINKOWSKI: Hell yeah we can. Sit tight. We'll be right there.

[Everyone share grins and shrieks with happiness as Jack and Kate look at each other]

[Cut to Jack's apartment. maps scatter the table. The whole place is a mess, and Jack sits on the floor drinking alcohol, flicking his flip-phone. He dials a number, and puts it to his ear]

VOICE: Hello.

JACK: Hello? It's me. Whoa whoa, wait, don't, don't hang up, please. I know what you said, I just. I just need to see ya, please? Yeah, yeah out at the airport. You know where. Thank you.

[Jack drives to the airport and parks up. Another car approaches. Jack steps out and the car stops. Out of the darkness appears Kate Austen. It is revealed that the whole episode hasn't consisted of flashbacks, but rather flash-forwards]

KATE: Hey.

JACK: Hey.

KATE: Saw you on the news. Still pulling people out of burning wreckage, huh?

JACK: Old habits.

KATE: You look terrible.

JACK: [Laughs] Thanks.

KATE: Why did you call me, Jack?

[Jack hands her his newspaper clipping]

JACK: I was hoping that you'd heard. That maybe you'd go to the funeral.

KATE: Why would I go to the funeral?

JACK: I've been flying a lot.

KATE: What?

JACK: Yeah that golden pass that they gave us. I, I've been using it. Every Friday night I, I fly from LA to Tokyo or, Singapore, Sydney. [Laughs] And then I, I get off and I, have a drink, and then I fly home.

KATE: Why?

JACK: Because I want it to crash, Kate. I don't care about anybody else on board. Every little bump we hit or turbulence, I mean I, I actually close my eyes and I pray that I can get back.

[Kate looks near tears as does Jack]

KATE: This is not gonna change.

JACK: No, I'm sick of lying. We made a mistake.

KATE: I have to go. He's gonna be wondering where I am...

[Jack grabs her]

JACK: We were not supposed to leave.

KATE: Yes, we were.

[She releases herself]

KATE: Goodbye, Jack.

[She heads for her car]

JACK: We have to go back, Kate.

[She gets in her car and drives away]

JACK: We have to go back!!

[A plane takes off over Jack's head]
