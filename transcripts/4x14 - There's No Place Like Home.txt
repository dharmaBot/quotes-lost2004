SAYID: Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you. But do you have the time, please?

GUY IN CAR: Yeah. It's eight fif--

[silenced gunshots]

[grunts]

HURLEY: Sayid?

SAYID: Hello, Hurley.

HURLEY: I think visiting hours are over, Dude.

SAYID: This isn't a visit. I want you to come with me.

HURLEY: Come with you where?

SAYID: Somewhere safe.

HURLEY: And why would I go anywhere with you? I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

SAYID: Because circumstances have changed.

HURLEY: What circumstances?

SAYID: Bentham's dead.

HURLEY: What?

SAYID: Two days ago.

HURLEY: What happened?

SAYID: They said it was suicide.

HURLEY: What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide? And why are you calling him "Bentham"? His name is--

SAYID: Don't say it. We're being watched.

HURLEY: Dude, I've been having regular conversations with dead people. The last thing I need now is paranoia.

SAYID: I just killed a man who's been perched outside this facility for the last week. I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.

HURLEY: We're not going back, are we?

SAYID: No. Just somewhere safe.

HURLEY: Okay then. Hold on a sec. Checkmate, Mr. Eko.

SAYID: Where's the freighter?

LAPIDUS: I don't know. I stayed on course. They must have it on the move again.

SAYID: How much fuel?

LAPIDUS: Four, five minutes worth, unless somebody else wants to jump.

JACK:[seeing Kate looking out the window] As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him.

HURLEY: Hey! There it is! The boat! I see it! Behind us!

[Breathing erratically]

[monitor beeping steadily]

LOCKE: Ben, help me. If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.

BEN: That's not my problem, John.

[Steady beeping continues]

[Keamy wheezes.]

LOCKE: Hang on, man. Hang on!

KEAMY: (Hoarsely) Wherever you go... Widmore... (breathing erratically) he'll find you.

[Steady beeping continues]

BEN: Not if I find him first.

[Monitor beeping erratically]

LOCKE: (whispers) Hey. No. No. (Normal voice) Hey. Hey! Hey!

[Beep]

[beep]

[beep]

MICHAEL: You two need to go now. Get everybody off the boat. We have maybe five minutes left in the tank. Go!

JIN: You go. Go. I stay.

[Valve squeaking]

[hissing]

[clank]

DESMOND: Oh, bloody hell. Don't land! You can't land! Don't land! Don't land! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Get away! There's a bomb! You can't land! Go back!

JACK: Did he say "bomb"?

DESMOND: Don't land!

JACK: What are you doing?!

LAPIDUS: I don't care what the hell he's screaming! I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down!

DESMOND: No! Don't land! (Hissing) No! No! Look, you don't understand! Jin and Michael are doing everything they can, but there's no time! You've gotta get off the boat now!

[Grunts]

[knocks]

JACK: How long till we can fly again?

LAPIDUS: Somebody patch the other hole where the bullet came out!

DESMOND: Give it to me. I'll do it.

LAPIDUS: Here! Somebody pump some gas!

JACK: I'll handle the fuel.

LAPIDUS: Get that life raft right there! Come on! Let's go!

[Aaron crying]

KATE: Hey, Sun! Sun! Where you going? We gotta go.

SUN: Jin's below with Michael. I can't--

KATE: No, no, there's no time! There's no time. We have to go.

SUN: I won't leave him!

KATE: Okay. You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin. All right?

LAPIDUS: Just keep pumping till I get it started! That'll be enough to get us to the island.

[Hissing resumes]

MICHAEL: Jin, you gotta go. There's nothing more we can do, man.

JIN: No, I can find--

MICHAEL: Hey, come on. It's over. I'm almost out of this stuff. Listen, you are a father now. Get to your wife and get her home.

JIN: Thank you, Michael.

MICHAEL: You're welcome. Go.

[Helicopter engine starting]

[man shouting indistinctly]

JACK: Hey! Not yet!

LAPIDUS: Your buddy said we got five minutes as of three minutes ago. If you're going, this is it. Let's go!

JACK: Kate! Come on!

KATE: Jin's still inside! Jin's still inside. We can't leave him behind.

JACK: Come on. Listen, I'm not leaving without you. We gotta get out of here now.

LAPIDUS: Let's go!

[Aaron continues crying]

DESMOND: Give me a minute! No! Wait!

SUN: Where's Jin?

[Man shouts indistinctly]

[shouting in Korean]

[Aaron continues crying]

SUN: It's Jin! No! Jin! Jin! Jin! We have to go back! Turn around!

LAPIDUS: We can't do it!

SUN: We have to! We need to go back!

[Hissing]

[hissing stops]

[ghostly voices whispering]

[whispering continues]

[whispering stops]

CHRISTIAN: You can go now, Michael.

MICHAEL: Who are you?

[Loud explosion]

SUN: (Shrieking) Jin! (Sobbing) Aah!

[Metal creaking loudly]

SUN: (Shrieking) Jin! 

[Sun gasping and sobbing]

SUN: Go back lower! We have to go find Jin!

JACK: Sun, there's nobody down there!

SUN: You can't see anything from here!

LAPIDUS: We didn't get enough fuel! We can't go back!

SUN: Go lower! I know he's there!

SAYID: Sun, I'm--Sun, I'm so sorry. He's not--

SUN: He's down there! I know he's down there!

LAPIDUS: We gotta go!

SUN: No! I'm not leaving him!

SAYID: Can't get to him!

SUN: No, we're not leaving him! We're not! Turn back around!

JACK: Sun! Sun! It's gone!

[Aaron wailing]

JACK: He's gone.

[Continues wailing]

KATE: Shh. Shh.

JACK: Lapidus! Fly us back to the island.

LAPIDUS: You got it.

[Aaron continues wailing]

SUN: No! (Sobbing) No! No! (Shrieking) No!

[In London, Sun walks alongside the Thames near the Tower Bridge. Her cell phone rings. She takes it out and opens it up.]

SUN: (In Korean)

MRS. PAIK: (Over phone, in Korean)

JI YEON: (Over phone, in Korean)

MRS. PAIK: (Over phone, in Korean)

[speaking indistinctly]

WIDMORE: All right, guys. Thanks.

SUN: Excuse me. Mr. Widmore?

WIDMORE: Yes.

SUN: I'm Sun Kwon... Mr. Paik's daughter. I'm the managing director of Paik Industries.

WIDMORE: Yes, of course. How is your father?

SUN: Excellent, thank you.

WIDMORE: Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him dinner after our last game.

SUN: Are you really going to pretend that you don't know who I am?

WIDMORE: I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Ms. Kwon.

SUN: Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore... just like you know we've been lying all this time about where we were and what happened to us there. You and I have common interests. When you're ready to discuss them...

[Sun hands Widmore her Paik Industries business card from her pocket.]

SUN: Call me. As you know, we're not the only ones who left the island.

[Sun turns and begins to walk away. Widmore calls after her.]

WIDMORE: Ms. Kwon? Why would you want to help me?

LOCKE: Why?

BEN: "Why" what?

LOCKE: Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat?

BEN: Well, John, I really wasn't thinking straight. Sometimes... good command decisions get compromised by bad emotional responses.

[Loud clatter]

BEN: I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job of separating the two than I ever did.

LOCKE: What are you doing?

[Mechanical whirring and crackling]

LOCKE: I asked you a question!

BEN: If I were you, I'd duck.

[Whirring and crackling grows louder]

[electricity crackling, hissing, rumbling]

[crackling, hissing and rumbling stop]

BEN: I better change.

[Waves crashing]

[panting and gasping]

[panting]

SAWYER: Nice day for a swim.

JULIET: What are you doing here?

SAWYER: Decided to take a dip.

[Sawyer regards Juliet's bottle of DHARMA-brand flavored rum.]

SAWYER: Whatcha celebratin'?

JULIET: I'm not celebrating.

[With a flick of her sad eyes, Juliet indicates behind Sawyer. He gets the point and looks to the ocean. A distant plume of black smoke wafts on the horizon.]

SAWYER: Is that our boat?

JULIET: It was. 

LOCKE: What's that for?

BEN: I'm going somewhere cold.

[Zips up jacket]

LOCKE: Then where is mine?

BEN: You don't need one because you're not going with me.

LOCKE: Yes, I am going with you.

BEN: No, John, you're not.

LOCKE: Jacob told me what we had to do. You don't get to make all the decisions--

BEN: He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how because he wants me to suffer the consequences.

LOCKE: What consequences?

BEN: Whoever moves the island can never come back. So I'd like you to get on the elevator, John, and go back up. Richard and my people will be waiting 2 miles east of the Orchid.

LOCKE: Waiting for me?

BEN: Ready, willing and able to share what they know. And then they will follow your every word. Good-bye, John. I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.

[Ben exhales deeply as he shakes Locke's hand.]

LOCKE: What do I tell 'em to do?

BEN: You'll find your way, John. You always do.

[Birds chirping]

[man and woman speaking indistinctly]

[fire crackling]

RICHARD: Hello, John. Welcome home.

[Loud clatter]

[breathing heavily]

[hollow thud]

[fabric rips]

[crowbar clanks]

[breathing heavily]

[lantern clatters]

[exhales sharply]

BEN: I hope you're happy now, Jacob.

[buzzing, magnetic humming]

[buzzing and humming continue]

[Aaron crying]

DESMOND: Yeah, what is that?

[Buzzing and humming continue]

[metal grinding]

[grunting]

[buzzing and humming grow louder]

[crying]

[crackling, pulsating]

[pulsating continues]

[Aaron continues crying]

[helicopter whirring]

[Aaron continues crying]

LAPIDUS: Where's the island? Where's the island?! Where the hell's the island?!

HURLEY: It's gone.

LAPIDUS: Where the hell am I gonna land this thing?!

JACK: There's another smaller island close by they took us to!

LAPIDUS: I got news for ya, Doc. There's nothing but water in every direction!

[Helicopter engine sputtering]

[alarm beeping]

LAPIDUS: Doesn't matter now. That's it, people! We're out of fuel!

[Beeping continues]

[wind blowing loudly, rotors slowing down]

LAPIDUS: Get your life vests on! We're going in! Brace yourselves!

[Wind blowing loudly]

SAYID: Desmond! The life raft!

LAPIDUS: Hold on!

[Whoosh, hissing] 

[Metal creaking]

KATE: Where's Jack?!

LAPIDUS: Kate! Where is he?!

SAYID: Are you okay?

KATE: Hurley, carry the baby.

[Gasping]

LAPIDUS: Sayid, are you all right?

SAYID: Yes!

HURLEY: Jack!

LAPIDUS: Where's Desmond?

KATE: Get the baby.

HURLEY: I got him.

[Kate grunts]

[Aaron crying]

[grunts]

LAPIDUS: Desmond?! Jack! Give me a hand!

[Sun gasps and grunts]

SUN: Here you go.

JACK: Get him to the raft. Get him to the raft. Get him up in the raft. We've gotta get him in the raft.

HURLEY: Is he breathing? Oh, my God. Is he breathing?

[Grunting]

[groans]

KATE: Oh, my god.

JACK: Oh, come on, Desmond.

[Panting]

JACK: One, two, three.

[Coughing]

JACK: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

HURLEY: Yeah.

[Coughing and gasping]

JACK: Yeah. Yeah.

[Coughing]

JACK: Yeah, you're all right.

HURLEY: You're all right, man. You're okay.

[Continues coughing]

HURLEY: Desmond.

JACK: That's it. You're all right. That's it.

[Desmond continues coughing]

[panting]

[coughs]

JACK: (whispers) It's okay. It's okay. We're alive. (Sighs deeply)

[loud creaking]

[grunts]

[switch clicks]

[sighs]

[telephone rings]

[ring]

KATE: Hello?

[Clicking]

KATE: Hello? Who's there?

[Ghostly voices whispering]

[buzzing]

[door opens, creaks]

[buzzing continues]

[gasps]

KATE: Don't move. Don't you touch my son!

[Gasps]

KATE: (Whispers) Claire? How did y--

CLAIRE: (voice breaks) Don't bring him back, Kate. (Chair creaks) Don't you dare bring him back.

[Gasps]

[panting]

[sighs]

[sighs deeply]

[sniffles]

KATE: (crying) I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[Water lapping]

HURLEY: Is he okay?

KATE: He's fine. It's a miracle.

HURLEY: I can't believe he did it.

KATE: Who did what?

HURLEY: Locke. He moved the island.

JACK: No, he didn't.

HURLEY: Oh, really? 'Cause... one minute it was there, and the next it was gone, so... unless we, like, overlooked it, Dude, that's exactly what he did. But... if you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it.

LAPIDUS: God almighty. There's a boat. There's a boat out there! There's a boat out there. Hey! There's a boat! You see it?! Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Does it see us?

DESMOND: I think it does!

SAYID: Hey!

HURLEY AND DESMOND: Hey!

LAPIDUS: Is it turning? It's turning! Hey! Hey!

JACK: (Softly) We're gonna have to lie.

KATE: What?

JACK: (Normal voice) We're gonna have to lie.

SAYID: Lie about what?

JACK: Everything, all of it, every moment since we crashed on the island.

LAPIDUS: Jack... now I know I'm new to this group and everything, but isn't this the place where everybody starts jumping up and down and hugging each other?

JACK: Your freighter... those men came to the island to kill us, all of us. You said that our plane was discovered on the bottom of the ocean. Well, someone put it there--someone who wants everyone to think that we're dead. So what do you think's gonna happen to us when we tell them that that wasn't our plane? What do you think's gonna happen to the people that we left behind?

KATE: Jack, we can't. We can't pull it off.

JACK: Just let me do the talking.

MAN: Aponta adiante, lá! Lá!

[Water lapping]

MAN: Uma jangada. Cheio de gente! São oito deles!

[engine whirring]

MAN: De onde eles vieram? De onde eles vieram?

HENRIK: Ei, aqui! Dá uma olhada aqui!

MAN: Depressa! Pega uns cobertores e a caixa de primeiros socorros. Traga pra aqui agora.

HENRIK: Uma jangada com pessoas, Ms. Widmore! (Pause) Ms. Widmore, venha à proa!

PENNY: Throw them a rope! Take them 'round to the stern!

DESMOND: Penny? Penny! Penny!

[Sighs]

[laughs]

[laughs]

PENNY: Are you okay?

DESMOND: (Chuckles) I'm--I'm fine. (Whispers) I'm fine. (Normal voice) H--how did you find me?

PENNY: Your phone call... I have a tracking station. (Sniffles)

DESMOND: I love you, Penny... and I'll never leave you again.

[Laughs]

MAN: Não, não, não. Não faz isso. Não faz isso. Tá bom, tá bom, tá bom. Chega pra lá. Chega, chega.

DESMOND: Uh... this is--this is Penny. This is, um, Kate and then Aaron.

KATE: Hi.

PENNY: Hi.

DESMOND: Um... and this is Sun, Sayid, Hurley.

HURLEY: Hi.

DESMOND: This is Frank. And Jack. Jack, this is--this is Penny.

JACK: It's nice to meet you, Penny.

PENNY: Hi.

JACK: (Sighs) But we need to talk. 

HURLEY: What's this place called?

SAYID: Membata.

HURLEY: Membata. Why are we doing this, Dude? Sailing 3,000 miles to another island?

SAYID: Because it's the only way to keep them safe.

[Lapidus grunts.]

JACK: How long till we'll hit land?

LAPIDUS: Well, if the wind's not too brutal... eight, nine hours. (Drops plank) Just long enough to give you a nice, convincing sunburn.

JACK: Well... it's been a pleasure, Frank. I hope we never see each other again.

LAPIDUS: Roger that, Doc. (Chuckles)

PENNY: [To AARON] Bye, sweetheart.

[Water lapping]

[exhales deeply]

DESMOND: Are you sure about this, brother?

JACK: Are you sure?

DESMOND: (Scoffs) As long as I've got Penny... I'll be fine.

JACK: Don't let him find you, Desmond. And I'll see you in another life, brother.

DESMOND: Aye. I guess you will.

JACK: All right. Let's go home.

[Villagers speaking indistinctly]

[Panting]

[Villagers shouting indistinctly]

[Aaron crying]

[The Pixies' "Gouge Away" plays in Jack's Ford Bronco as Jack cruises down a Los Angeles street.]

[Sleeping on your belly /
You break my arms, /
You spoon my eyes /
Been rubbing a bad charm]

[Jack's brakes squeal as he stops in front of Hoffs/Drawler Funeral Home.]

[With holy fingers /
Gouge away /
You can--]

[Jack parks and turns off the engine. He sniffles as he gets out and approaches the building. A train horn blows in the distance. Jack tries the doorknob, but it's locked. He rattles it again. Dogs bark in the distance. The train horn continue to blow. Jack picks up a stray chunk of cement and--CLANK--bashes on the doorknob once, putting a gash in the door. Another hit--CLANK--and the doorknob breaks and bends out. A third hit with the cement chunk and the knob is knocked clean off. Jack pushes his way inside the funeral parlor.]

[With a BANG of the door, Jack breaks inside the mortuary of the funeral home. Jack sighs and flicks on the light switch. There, inside, is Jeremy Bentham's coffin. Jack approaches the coffin. The body claim form, unfilled except for the name, sits on a clipboard on the top of the coffin. Jack throws the clipboard onto the stainless steel body preparation table behind him. From the sound of it, a plane flies overhead as Jack lifts the upper cover of the coffin and looks at the body inside.]

BEN: Hello, Jack.

[Jack is startled almost off his balance by the voice. The sound of vehicles passing by can be heard from outside.]

BEN: Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Did he tell you that I was off the island?

JACK: (Exhales deeply) Yes, he did.

BEN: When did you speak to him?

JACK: (Inhales deeply) About a month ago.

BEN: And Kate?

JACK: Yeah. Yeah, he came to see her, too.

BEN: And what did he say to you?

JACK: He told me... that after I left the island, some very bad things happened. And he told me that it was my fault for leaving. And he said that I had to come back.

BEN: Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes... hoping that you'd crash. It's dark, Jack, very dark.

JACK: Why are you here?

BEN: I'm here to tell you that the island won't let you come alone. All of you have to go back.

JACK: (Scoffs) Are you... (sighs) Sayid--I don't even know where Sayid is. Hurley... (scoffs) is insane. Sun blames me for... and then Kate... (chuckles, sighs) She won't even talk to me anymore.

BEN: Perhaps I can help you with that. This is the way it has to be, Jack. It's the only way. You have to do it together, all of you.

JACK: How?

BEN: I have a few ideas.

[Jack sighs deeply and turns to leave.]

BEN: Jack... I said, all of you. We're gonna have to bring him, too.

[Jack, standing feet from Ben and facing him in the tiny mortuary, turns back and looks at the body in the coffin. Ben regards the body for a moment too. The well-dressed, peaceful-looking body in the coffin, the body of Jeremy Bentham, is the body of John Locke.]
