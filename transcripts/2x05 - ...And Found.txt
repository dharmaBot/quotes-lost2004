[Sun and Claire on the beach.]

SUN: It's been 4 days.

CLAIRE: You know, that's not that long. They said it could take up to 2 weeks to find a current. I mean, Michael knew what he was doing. I doubt anything...

[Sun notices that her wedding ring is gone. She starts frantically looking around and speaking in Korean.]

CLAIRE: What? What?

[Sun continues looking for her ring and speaking Korean.]

CLAIRE: Sun, what's wrong?

SUN: My wedding ring, it's gone.

[FLASHBACK to Sun putting a hair pin in her hair. Her mother enters.]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: You're not planning on wearing that, are you?]

SUN: [Subtitle: What's wrong with this?]

[Mrs. Paik picks up a pair of pumps and takes them away.]

SUN: [Subtitle: Hey -- I like those shoes!]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: I like them, too, but you're not going to wear these. He might be shorter than you... ]

[Mrs. Paik brings Sun a pair of shorter heeled shoes.]

SUN: [Subtitle: This is ridiculous, Mother.]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: If you'd found a husband in college we wouldn't need a matchmaker.]

SUN: [Subtitle: I went to college to get a degree.]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: And after four years of college, you're "silver". Don't you want to find a husband before you turn "bronze"?]

SUN: [Subtitle: I'll find a husband when the time is right.]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: Well, your father says the time is now.]

[Cut to Jin and his friend in an apartment. Jin is putting on a suit while Tai Soo looks at a "destiny book".]

TAI: [Subtitle: I'm telling you, man, this year love will find you.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Well if the destiny book says it, it must be true.]

TAI: [Subtitle: My grandma used this book to meet my grandfather. It never fails.]

JIN: [Subtitle: What kind of woman? I mean, what's she look like, so I'll know when I see her?]

TAI: [Subtitle: Orange.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Orange?]

TAI: [Subtitle: Yes, love will look... orange.]

JIN: [Subtitle: I can't take care of a woman, I can barely take care of myself!]

TAI: [Subtitle: You could always let a woman take care of you.]

JIN: [Subtitle: That's not what a man does. A man needs a goal in life. He works harder than anyone. He gets promoted. Then he'll be respected -- not like the son of a fisherman.]

TAI: [Subtitle: It's just a job interview, Jin.]

JIN: [Subtitle: A very important job interview. [Standing to show off his clothes] How do I look? Stunning, huh?]

TAI: [Subtitle: Yeah, stunning. [He stops Jin from leaving] You forgot to cut the tag off!]

JIN: [Subtitle: Are you kidding? If I cut it off, how can I return it? This tie cost a fortune!]

TAI: [Subtitle: So, Jin, what should I do if Love calls?]

JIN: [Subtitle: Tell it to wait.]

[Jin, Michael and Sawyer in the bleak bunker. The tail section people are off to one side talking.]

MICHAEL: Hey man, it's okay. Sun -- you'll be with her again. Soon, okay. Hey, I think they're trying to figure out what to do with us.

SAWYER: I think they're going to eat us.

ANA LUCIA: All right, all of you -- get up. We're moving out.

MICHAEL: Moving out where?

ANA LUCIA: You're going to help us get food and water.

SAWYER: What -- we work for you now?

ANA LUCIA: You're going to do it because we have a long walk ahead of us.

SAWYER: A long walk where?

ANA LUCIA: Back to where you came from.

[COMMERCIAL BREAK]

[Tail section folks and rafters coming out of their bunker.]

ANA LUCIA: All clear.

SAWYER: [quietly to Michael] Hey Mike, I think we ought to stage a prison break here.

MICHAEL: Yeah, well I want to figure out what the hell's going on over here before I make any decisions about anything.

ANA LUCIA: Okay people, listen up. We need to gather as much food and water as we can. You travel in pairs. You move as fast as you can. Don't make any noise.

MICHAEL: Maybe you could just take a minute to explain us what the hell is going on over here that's got you all so on edge.

ANA LUCIA: You know what? That's a great idea, maybe we can swap stories on the road.

LEADER: I'm going to go scout before we move.

SAWYER: [under his breath] I think she needs to be slapped.

ANA LUCIA: Cindy, go with him. Libby, see what fruit you can gather. Take him with you.

LIBBY: His name is Michael.

ANA LUCIA: Yeah, right, Michael.

SAWYER: [whispering to Michael] Wait.

MICHAEL: I'll be okay, man. Don't worry.

ANA LUCIA: Bernard and I will gather the fish.

JIN: Fish. [He points to himself.]

SAWYER: The man knows how to fish. I'd take him with you if I were you.

ANA LUCIA: Fine, he comes with us, too.

[Sun going through her clothes and things looking for her ring. Jack enters.]

JACK: Sun, you okay?

SUN: I lost my wedding ring.

JACK: When was the last time you saw it?

SUN: I'm so used to it. I don't, I don't know.

JACK: I lost my wedding ring once. It's crazy where you look when you want to find something bad enough. I went through the garbage outside the house -- emptied the bags and everything. I even took apart the pipes in my bathroom because I was convinced that it had gone down the drain in the sink.

SUN: What did your wife say?

JACK: She never knew.

SUN: How is that?

JACK: I went to a jeweler and I had a replica made, that's how. Yeah, now it's just rattling around in my sock drawer back home. Um, I can help you look.

SUN: No, thanks. I'm sure it will turn up.

[Jin throwing pieces of an urchin into the surf while Ana Lucia and Bernard struggle with a net.]

ANA LUCIA: Hey, hey, you want to help us out over here?

[Jin shakes his head.]

ANA LUCIA: You want to eat? Help us.

[Jin says something in Korean.]

ANA LUCIA: Does it look like I speak Korean?

[Jin throws his net into the water and catches several fish.]

JIN: Fish.

[FLASHBACK to Jin at his job interview.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: You worked at the Asiana Hotel.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Yes, sir.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: As a busboy?]

JIN: [Subtitle: I became a waiter, sir.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: They don't promote from within.]

JIN: [Subtitle: No, sir. Not usually. I believe I was one of the few exceptions.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: What village are you from?]

JIN: [Subtitle: Sir?]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: You're obviously not from the city. What village are you from?]

JIN: [Subtitle: Namhae. On the south coast.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: No wonder. I thought I smelled fish on you.]

[Mr. Kim pulls the tag off of Jin's tie.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: This was sticking out.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Thank you, sir.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: (Picks up the phone) Mr. Kwon will be joining us. [To Jin] You will start immediately. You work rain or shine. You don't ask for a raise or time off.

[A man enters the room and gives Jin a uniform.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: And Mr. Kwon? The Seoul Gateway is one of the finest hotels in the country. Do not open the door for people like you.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Yes, sir. I understand. I will do my best. Thank you, sir.]

[Michael and Libby walking in the jungle.]

LIBBY: Sorry, Michael.

MICHAEL: Sorry about what?

LIBBY: You know, about throwing you and your friends into the pit.

MICHAEL: Friends.

LIBBY: What?

MICHAEL: I guess I just never thought about it like that. I mean, I guess one of them is my friend.

LIBBY: I'm guessing not the redneck.

MICHAEL: Yeah, not the redneck.

LIBBY: I don't think I've ever seen someone so scared in my life. And I know about scared.

MICHAEL: That why you threw us in the pit -- because you're scared?

LIBBY: And we've got trust issues.

MICHAEL: Huh, how about that? Where the hell are all the fruit?

LIBBY: We picked these trees pretty clean. Sometimes you can find them on the ground.

MICHAEL: Why don't you head inland? That's where all the fruit is on our side.

LIBBY: We don't go that way.

MICHAEL: Why?

LIBBY: Because that's where They come from.

[Sawyer sitting nursing his arm while Ana Lucia, Bernard, Cindy and Jin sort through the fish. A giant knife gets planted in a piece of wood next to Sawyer's head, stirring him from a drowse.]

LEADER: For your protection when we travel.

SAWYER: Did you make this? So what's your name, anyway?

LEADER: Mister Eko

[Sawyer opens his mouth to question him]

SAWYER: Mr. Echo?

EKO: Yes.

SAWYER: So what's that, like Mr. Ed?

[Libby enters, running.]

LIBBY: [to Ana Lucia] It's Michael, he just left.

ANA LUCIA: What?

LIBBY: He just said something and he went into the jungle. He's gone.

ANA LUCIA: Let's go. We're leaving now.

SAWYER: What do you mean, we're leaving?

ANA LUCIA: Your buddy ran off into the jungle.

LIBBY: Michael, he just left.

JIN: Michael. [Then he says something to Sawyer in Korean.]

BERNARD: What's he trying to say? What's he saying?

JIN: [continuing to speak in Korean at first] Walt! Walt!

[COMMERCIAL BREAK]

ANA LUCIA: Let's go. We're moving out now. Cindy, water. Libby, can you carry the radio?

SAWYER: Wait, you have a radio? Does it work? Can you use it?

ANA LUCIA: Wow, what a great idea! You going to slow us down?

JIN: No! Michael.

ANA LUCIA: We're leaving before he can tell Them where we are.

JIN: [to Sawyer] Michael.

SAWYER: What are we supposed to do, wait for him? He ain't coming back without his kid. Walt - he ain't coming back without Walt. You really think he's going to find him? In case you haven't noticed it's every man for himself, Chewie. Mike's got to worry about Mike. And I've got to worry about me.

[Jin starts to leave, but Eko stops him.]

EKO: Wait, please.

[Jin punches him, and Eko headbutts Jin and he falls. Jin gets up and Eko lets him pass.]

EKO: You're going the wrong way. [He points in the opposite direction] That's where he's going. Toward Them.

[Eko hands Jin a stick weapon.]

ANA LUCIA: [to Eko] What are you doing?

EKO: I'm going to help him find his friend.

ANA LUCIA: We can't wait for you.

EKO: I don't expect you to.

[Sun and Hurley on the beach.]

HURLEY: All you've got to do is retrace your steps. Like, what'd you do yesterday?

SUN: I woke up, washed up, walked with Shannon, picked some fruit, cut it up to feed Vincent. And then I was...

HURLEY: Whoa, you fed the dog? [Sun nods] Bingo!

[Hurley and Sun sitting nearby Vincent, watching him.]

HURLEY: So, Seoul. Is that in the good Korea or the bad Korea?

SUN: The good one.

HURLEY: Did you go to the Olympics?

SUN: Hurley, this is ridiculous. Waiting here for... the dog did not eat my ring.

HURLEY: Dude, dogs will eat anything. When I was a kid, my dog, Buster -- I had this drawer where I'd throw in all my change, right -- and I guess there were some Smarties in there -- so, like, the next day, Buster craps out a $1.35 in nickels. [Sun doesn't respond.] Did you ever own a dog?

SUN: Yes. Jin gave me one, a puppy.

HURLEY: What was his name?

SUN: Bpo Bpo.

HURLEY: Bpo Bpo -- that mean something?

SUN: Yes, it means a kiss.

HURLEY: A kiss.

[FLASHBACK to Sun getting out of a car with her mother; arriving at her "date."]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: Keep your hands in your lap, okay? In fact, don't speak unless they ask you a direct question.]

[They are greeted by the matchmaker, Mrs. Shin.]

MRS. SHIN: [Subtitle: Isn't she a beauty! You're going to love him! He's handsome... well educated... and his family owns this hotel, and twelve others.]

JIN: [Working as the doorman, inconspicuously opening the door] [Subtitle: Good afternoon! Welcome to the Seoul Gateway!]

[Sun and her mother at a table with her "date," Jae Lee, and his mother.]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: Your hotel is so lovely...]

MRS. LEE: [Subtitle: Oh, please, you are too kind... I understand your daughter attended Seoul National University...]

MRS. PAIK: [Subtitle: Yes, but it's certainly no Harvard.]

MRS. SHIN: [Subtitle:All right... let's give these two some time to get to know each other.]

JAE: [Subtitle: So, who's pressuring you more? Your mother or your father?]

SUN: [Subtitle: Definitely, my father... via my mother. What about you?]

JAE: [Subtitle: My father... via my mother... via my aunt.. via my grandmother. What did you study?]

SUN: [Subtitle: Art history.]

JAE: [Subtitle: To be honest I don't know anything about art.]

SUN: [Subtitle: What did you study?]

JAE: [Subtitle: Medieval Russian Literature... but somehow I ended up in hotel management.]

SUN: [Subtitle: Yeah, somehow.]

JAE: [Subtitle: I usually dread these set-ups... but today is... different.]

SUN: [Subtitle: Yes, for me too.]

[Eko and Jin walking in the jungle. They stop, then Jin starts off again.]

EKO: No.

JIN: Michael.

EKO: Wait, no.

[Jin hears something, and sees something moving. A boar charges and knocks Jin over, leaving him rolling down a hill. He stops near a dead body with a stake sticking out of its chest.]

EKO: [entering] His name was Goodwin.

JIN: Others?

[Eko nods.]

[COMMERCIAL BREAK]

[Eko breaks off a piece of aloe.]

JIN: Michael?

EKO: No, for your cut. [He sits] So, you're married? Your ring. You have a wife?

JIN: Yes. You?

EKO: Worse. Your wife, what is her name? Her name?

JIN: Sun.

EKO: She was with you? On the plane? [Jin nods.]

[Sun in her garden looking for her ring. She gets angry and starts ripping up plants. She sits down and cries. Locke enters.]

LOCKE: Bad day? [He hands her a handkerchief] It's clean.

SUN: Thank you.

LOCKE: You mind if I sit? [She motions for him to sit.]

SUN: Did you see me?

LOCKE: Rip apart your garden? No. [She laughs.] Sometimes I wish I had a garden to tear apart.

SUN: I don't think I have ever seen you angry.

LOCKE: Oh, I used to get angry all the time. Frustrated too.

SUN: You are not frustrated anymore?

LOCKE: I'm not lost anymore.

SUN: How did you do that?

LOCKE: Same way anything lost gets found -- I stopped looking.

[FLASHBACK to Sun sitting alone at a table, waiting for her "date."]

[Jin opening the door as a customer leaves. A car pulls up and he opens the car door for Jae.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Good afternoon, Mr. Lee.]

JAE: [Referring to the flower on Jin's lapel] [Subtitle: You mind if I borrow that? I've got a date.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Of course, sir.]

JAE: [Subtitle: Thanks. Your name is...?]

JIN: [Subtitle: Jin Soo Kwon, sir.]

JAE: [Subtitle: Thank you, Mr. Kwon.]

[Jae and Sun in the restaurant.]

JAE: [Subtitle: ...then the card slips out of the door and there I am in the hallway, wearing only a towel!]

SUN: [Subtitle: I thought that only happened in movies.]

JAE: [Subtitle: I had to convince the maid I owned the hotel... but she didn't believe me! How embarrassing!]

SUN: [Subtitle: I can't believe how... normal you are. ]

JAE: [Subtitle: I think you're great too, Sun. So... I'd really like for us to keep seeing each other. Our parents will be so thrilled. No more "matchmakers." No more pressure. We can be free. Can I tell you a secret?]

SUN: [Subtitle: Of course. ]

JAE: [Subtitle: When I was at Harvard, I met an American woman... I haven't told my father yet, but... in six months, I'm going to move there and marry her. [Sun looks hurt/embarrassed] Wait... you didn't think -- ]

SUN: [Subtitle: Of course not. America. That's wonderful.]

JAE: [Subtitle: I thought you...]

SUN: [Subtitle: I'm very happy for you.]

MANAGER: [Subtitle: Good afternoon, sir. Is there anything else you need?]

JAE: [Subtitle: No, we're fine. Thanks. ]

MANAGER: [Subtitle: (to Sun) Would you care for some coffee or dessert?]

SUN: [Subtitle: No, thank you. In fact, I have an appointment.]

JAE: [Subtitle: Sun...]

SUN: [Subtitle: Thank you so much for lunch.]

[Jin and Eko walking in the jungle. Jin veers off left.]

EKO: No, not that way. Over here.

[He sees a footprint.]

EKO: A round heel. This is fresh. These tracks...

JIN: Michael.

EKO: Yes, Michael. They don't leave tracks.

[They continue on, but Eko stops suddenly to look and listen. Jin says something in Korean but Eko ignores him. Jin says it louder and Eko puts his hand over Jin's mouth and shushes him. Then we see them hidden in the brush with just their eyes showing. Then we see several sets of legs walking by, the last one carrying a teddy bear hanging from a string.]

[COMMERCIAL BREAK]

[Jin and Eko get up from their hiding place, and Jin makes to follow the people that walked by.]

JIN: Michael.

EKO: No, they don't have him. They came from that way [pointing.] Your friend went that way [pointing in the other direction], crossed ahead of them... very lucky.

JIN: You, go back. I go.

EKO: No, we go together.

[FLASHBACK to Jin working his doorman gig, as Sun walks out (from her lunch with Jae). A man hails Jin.]

POOR MAN: [Subtitle: Excuse me? Excuse me, please? May my son use the bathroom inside? Please, sir. It's an emergency.]

JIN: [Subtitle: I'm sorry, sir -- hotels guests only. There is a bathroom down the street. [To the boy] Can you hold it? [The boy shakes his head.]]

POOR MAN: [Subtitle: I'm sorry. He really has to go.]

JIN: [Subtitle: All right. Go ahead. It's to the left. But please... be quick.]

POOR MAN: [Subtitle: Thank you -- you're a good man.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Please... please go.]

[Jin's boss walks up.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: Mr. Kwon... what did I tell you about who you let inside? ]

JIN: [Subtitle: I apologize, sir.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: Consider this your first warning.

JIN: [Subtitle: It's just that the little boy...]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: He can piss in the gutter for all I care. You people are used to that. If you want to keep your job go find them and get them out of here!]

[Jin takes off his gloves and hat.]

MR. KIM: [Subtitle: What are you doing?]

JIN: [Handing him the gloves and hat] [Subtitle: Thank you for the opportunity, sir.]

[Sun sitting at the beach rubbing her ring finger. Kate enters.]

KATE: Hey.

SUN: Hello.

KATE: [Referring to the ocean] It's pretty. Hurley told me that you lost your wedding ring.

SUN: I was just sitting here telling myself it's silly to be so upset about it -- it is just a thing.

KATE: Well, they've only been gone a few days, and...

SUN: Don't. I'm sick of everyone saying he's alright. He's not alright. Claire found the bottle -- the one with the messages inside -- the one from the raft.

KATE: Where is it?

SUN: I buried it.

[Ana Lucia and company walking in the jungle. Sawyers sits.]

ANA LUCIA: Stop. [to Cindy] Let me see your water. [She hands the water to Sawyer] You keep slowing us down, we're going to leave you behind.

SAWYER: Go ahead, leave me behind.

ANA LUCIA: See ya.

SAWYER: Got a question for you.

ANA LUCIA: Yeah?

SAWYER: Now that your tracker's gone how are you going to find our camp without me?

ANA LUCIA: Walk across the island, follow the beaches. And Eko's coming back.

SAWYER: You married?

ANA LUCIA: What?

SAWYER: You married?

ANA LUCIA: No.

SAWYER: Too bad, you seem suited for it.

ANA LUCIA: Funny. What about you?

SAWYER: No ma'am.

ANA LUCIA: You gay?

SAWYER: [getting up] Funny. Let's go. What are we waiting for?

[Eko and Jin come to a stream and get some water.]

EKO: Wait here, we lost his trail. I'll go back and find it.

[Jin is washing up and we see Michael's orange shirt come into frame.]

MICHAEL: What are you doing? Go back.

JIN: Michael!

MICHAEL: Go back, man!

[Michael runs off, and Jin's follows.]

[COMMERCIAL BREAK]

MICHAEL: Walt! Walt! Walt!

JIN: Michael.

MICHAEL: Go away! I'm not going back without him. Walt! I'm here! Where are you, man? [Jin runs up to where Michael stopped by a waterfall] Walt!! [Jin tries to quiet Michael] What, you worried they're going to hear me? Let them take me! Come! Come take me!

EKO: [appearing] Shouting is not a good idea. You need to come back with us now.

MICHAEL: I'm not leaving him out here. [Eko approaches and Michael brandishes a stick] Stay away from me.

EKO: I know they took your son. But you have no idea what these people are capable of -- and they will not be found if they don't want to be.

MICHAEL: They took him right out of my hands -- right out of my hands! I'm not going back without him.

JIN: You find Walt, Michael. [The intention here is: You will find Walt, but you need to come with us now.]

[Michael leaves with Jin and Eko.]

[Sun digging up the bottle.]

KATE: Can I see it?

[Kate starts going through the messages a bit frantically.]

SUN: Kate! Those are private. Kate, stop. What are you doing?!

KATE: We didn't, uh... I didn't say goodbye.

SUN: Sawyer?

[Kate looks down and smiles.]

KATE: Sun?

[Kate moves her head in the direction she was looking to make Sun look. Sun sees her ring in the sand. She cries and puts in on.]

[Jin looking at his ring. FLASHBACK to Jin walking along a river embankment in Seoul. He sees a girl in an orange dress and turns to look at her. As he turns back, he runs into Sun and she drops her purse.]

SUN: [Subtitle: Oh, excuse me.]

JIN: [Subtitle: Are you okay? Here you are [handing Sun her bag]. ]

[Then they gaze into each other's eyes. And it's love at first sight.]

[Sun on the beach crying and happy and scared.]
