[Original timeline - Locke's camp is seen through night vision goggles ... Sawyer hands Kate a mug.]

SAWYER: Want some cocoa?

KATE: Where'd you find cocoa?

SAWYER: I didn't. Pretend.

[Locke approaches Jin, who is bandaging his leg]

LOCKE: How's the leg?

JIN: Still hurts.

LOCKE: You should leave the bandage off for awhile. The air'll do it some good.

JIN: I'll try that.

LOCKE: You mind if I sit down?

[Jin nods and Locke sits.]

LOCKE: I know you and I haven't had time to talk, but I was wondering if James had filled you in on what I showed him at the cliffs.

JIN: You mean the cave? The one with the names on the wall?

LOCKE: Most of the names have been crossed off now. There are just a few left. Kwon is one of them.

[Claire eavesdrops on their conversation.]

JIN: Does that mean me or Sun?

LOCKE: Well Jin, I'm not sure. But what it does mean is that the only way we can leave the island is if all the names that haven't been crossed off go together.

JIN: But, Sun is not here...

LOCKE: You just take care of that leg. I'm workin' on it.

[Locke gets up and walks away.]

[Flash-sideways timeline - Sun waits in the airport as Jin cooperates with security.]

SECURITY OFFICER: Alright Mr. Kwon, here's your suitcase and your watch.

[Jin waits for a moment.]

JIN: Money?

SECURITY OFFICER: I'm sorry, federal law says we have to confiscate the $25,000.

JIN: Confiscate?

SECURITY OFFICER: It means that if you want it back, you're gonna have to fill out the necessary paperwork.

[Jin mutters in Korean.]

JIN: Money...

SECURITY OFFICER: You can exit right over there, sir.

[Frustrated, Jin turns to Sun.]

JIN: [Subtitled] Let's go.

SUN: [Subtitled] Are you okay?

JIN: [Subtitled] I've missed the meeting at the restaurant.

SUN: [Subtitled] What was the money for?

JIN: [Subtitled] I don't know. Your father gave it to me right before we left. He told me to deliver it with the watch. I don't ask your father questions. I do what he tells me.

[Some time later, they approach the front desk at a hotel.]

CLERK: May I help you?

[Sun hands him some papers.]

SUN: Paik.

CLERK: A reservation for Paik...

[He checks his computer.]

CLERK: Yes, I've got it right here. I've got a beautiful oceanview room for you on the eighth floor.

JIN: Two room. Two! No marry.

CLERK: Oh...

JIN: Kwon. Jin-Soo Kwon.

CLERK: I'm sorry, I apologize... yes, there is a separate room reservation for Kwon. Room 842. Here you go, sir.

[He hands Jin a room key.]

CLERK: Ms. Paik, Mr. Kwon... welcome to Los Angeles.

[Original timeline - Locke approaches Sayid, who is chopping wood.]

LOCKE: I'm leavin' for a little while. I got an errand to run.

SAYID: When will you be back?

LOCKE: Morning. Keep an eye on the camp while I'm gone.

[Locke turns to leave.]

SAYID: I don't feel anything.

LOCKE: Excuse me?

SAYID: Anger. Happiness. Pain. I don't feel it anymore.

LOCKE: Maybe that's best, Sayid. It'll help you get through what's coming.

[Locke walks into the jungle. Jin immediately starts gathering his things.]

SAWYER: What're you doin', Hoss?

JIN: I'm getting out of here before that thing comes back.

SAWYER: What thing?

JIN: Locke. And you're just sitting around here listening to whatever he tells you...

SAWYER: I ain't listenin' to nobody! I already told you I have a deal with Widmore, so if you just--

JIN: It doesn't matter who you have a deal with! I've waited long enough. I'm going to find my wife.

SAWYER: Find her where?

JIN: Go back to the temple. And if she's not there I'll try the beach. But I will find Sun so stop trying to--

[Jin is silenced by a tranquilizer dart. Sawyer and the rest of Locke's camp soon follow. Armed men with night vision goggles step out of the jungle and examine the bodies.]

SEAMUS: Is this the guy?

[Zoe stares down at Jin.]

ZOE: Yeah. Let's take him.

[They lift Jin's unconscious body.]

[Original timeline - Miles and Frank play cards on the beach.]

MILES: Play your card, captain.

[Frank throws down a card. Nearby, Ben watches Ilana clean her rifle]

BEN: Now what?

ILANA: We wait.

BEN: Wait... for what?

ILANA: For Richard to come back.

BEN: You'll forgive my skepticism, but... the last thing Richard said before he went stomping off into the jungle was that we were all in Hell and he had no idea what we were supposed to do next! In fact, I would bet money we never see him again!

ILANA: Hugo will find him. He will track him down and bring him back.

MILES: Unless Alpert's covered in bacon grease, I'm not sure Hurley can track anything...

FRANK: Hey, don't talk about bacon.

ILANA: Jacob has never lied to me before. If he said Richard knows what to do, then Richard knows what to do. He'll come back. And until then, we wait.

[Sun throws a piece of fruit in anger, then stabs a knife into the table. She storms off to her garden where Jack finds her pulling weeds.]

JACK: How are the tomatoes?

SUN: Dead.

JACK: I remember when you first planted this here. Feels like a hundred years ago...

[Sun remains silent.]

JACK: You don't believe Alpert's coming back, do you?

SUN: I don't care if he comes back.

JACK: What about us... being candidates?

SUN: What about it?

JACK: Hurley took me to a lighthouse. To Jacob's lighthouse. And there was a mirror. And all around it there were... there were hundreds of names written down.

SUN: I don't care. I don't care about Alpert, or being a candidate.

JACK: Sun... there was a reason why we were--

SUN: I don't want to hear about how this is our purpose or destiny! I just want you to go away and leave me alone!

[Jack walks away as Sun cries.]

[Flash-sideways timeline - Jin knocks on the door of Sun's hotel room, she answers.]

SUN: [Subtitled] Jin... what are you doing?

[He is carrying the watch from her father.]

JIN: [Subtitled] Your father sent me halfway around the world to deliver the watch... so I'm going to the restaurant.

SUN: [Subtitled] Will you come inside? I don't want to have this conversation here.

[Jin enters the room.]

SUN: [Subtitled] It's eleven-thirty. No one's going to be at the restaurant.

JIN: [Subtitled] I should still try...

SUN: [Subtitled] Jin... this man works for my father. It's not going to be a problem.

JIN: [Subtitled] What do you care? You're here for a shopping trip.

SUN: [Subtitled] So that's all you think of me? That I'm here to shop?

JIN: [Subtitled] No...

[Sun unbuttons the top button of her blouse.]

SUN: [Subtitled] Maybe you should tell me to button it... like you did on the plane?

JIN: [Subtitled] It was a crowded flight... I didn't know who might be watching us.

SUN: [Subtitled] No one is watching us. So... do you want me to button it?

JIN: [Subtitled] No.

[Sun unbuttons a second button.]

SUN: [Subtitled] What about... this one?

JIN: [Subtitled] No.

[Sun unbuttons the final button.]

SUN: [Subtitled] And this one?

JIN: [Subtitled] No... definitely not that one.

[Sun removes her blouse ... they kiss passionately.]

[Original timeline - Sun continues pulling weeds in her garden, she cuts her hand.]

LOCKE: Sun...

[Sun is startled.]

LOCKE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Bad day?

SUN: What are you doing here?

LOCKE: I found your husband.

SUN: What?

LOCKE: I promised you I would reunite you two... took me a little longer than I thought it would... but he's with my people, back at my camp across the island. I can take you to him right now.

SUN: I don't believe you. You killed those people at the temple...

LOCKE: Those people were confused. They were lied to. I didn't want to hurt them. Any one of them could have chosen to come with me. And I'm giving you that choice, Sun... right now. I would never make you do anything against your will. I'm asking you. Please. Come with me. Jin's waiting.

[Sun runs away.]

LOCKE: Sun!

[Locke chases after her.]

LOCKE: Sun, wait!

[Original timeline - Sun slams into a tree while running from Locke.]

[Flash-sideways timeline - Sun wakes in bed next to Jin]

SUN: [Subtitled] I've got an idea...

JIN: [Subtitled] What's that?

SUN: [Subtitled] Let's run away.

JIN: [Subtitled] What?

SUN: [Subtitled] I'm serious. Let's run away.

JIN: [Subtitled] How could we do that?

SUN: [Subtitled] I've got an account.

[Jin gets out of bed, troubled.]

JIN: [Subtitled] This was your plan all along?

SUN: [Subtitled] Are you angry?

JIN: [Subtitled] No... but what you're saying... it's forbidden.

SUN: [Subtitled] Do you want to be with me or not?

JIN: [Subtitled] Of course I do. I love you.

SUN: [Subtitled] Good. Then there's something you need to know...

[A knock at the door startles them.]

JIN: [Subtitled] Who is that?

SUN: [Subtitled] I don't know. I put out the sign...

JIN: [Subtitled] Tell them you're sleeping.

[Jin hides in the bathroom. Sun checks herself out in the mirror and gets lost in a meaningful look, a second round of knocking brings her back to reality, she opens the door.]

KEAMY: Miss Paik? Hi. I'm, uh... Martin Keamy.

[Sun doesn't recognize him.]

KEAMY: I'm a friend of your father's.

[Sun does not reply.]

KEAMY: Mind if I come in? I believe you've got something for me...

[He steps past her into the room.]

[Original timeline - Sun lays unconscious in the jungle. Ben stumbles upon her and attempts to rouse her.]

BEN: Sun? Sun, can you hear me?

[Sun groans and sits up.]

BEN: What happened? You alright?

[Sun speaks in Korean.]

SUN: [Subtitled] Where is he?

BEN: I'm sorry, what?

SUN: [Subtitled] He was chasing me... he was here... I saw him. He was--

BEN: Slow down. Tell me what happened in English. Who did this to you?

SUN: Locke.

[Across the island, Locke returns to his camp and finds his people still unconscious ... he pulls a dart out of Sayid and wakes him]

LOCKE: Sayid! Sayid, hey! What happened?

SAYID: We were attacked.

LOCKE: By whom?

SAYID: I don't know.

LOCKE: Where is Jin?

[On Hydra island, Jin wakes in Room 23. He attempts to open the door but it won't budge, he bangs on it.]

JIN: Hey! Hey!

[No one comes to his aid, he flips a switch and the brainwashing video begins to play, he turns it off.]

ZOE: Well... that was weird, huh?

JIN: Where am I?

ZOE: It's called Room 23. The Dharma Initiative was doing experiments on subliminal messaging in here. But... you know all about the Dharma Initiative... don't you, Mr. Kwon?

JIN: Why did you bring me here?

ZOE: Relax. You're safe.

JIN: I'm leaving.

[Zoe sighs and hits him with a taser, he slumps to the floor.]

ZOE: Sorry, but we went to a lot of trouble getting you here off of the other island. And I can't let you leave.

JIN: What do you want from me?

[Zoe produces a map.]

ZOE: These are grid maps that the Dharma people used to identify pockets of electromagnetism. Whoever signed these could really help me out. I know... I know the writing's diffcult to read but... but it sure looks like it says Jin Soo-Kwon. So, is it you or isn't it?

JIN: You want answers to your questions? Then get me your boss. I want to talk to Charles Widmore.

ZOE: Well... then you're in luck, Mr. Kwon. Because he'd like to talk to you too.

[Back on the main island, Locke talks with Sayid.]

LOCKE: You a good swimmer?

SAYID: Good enough.

[Locke hands him a pistol.]

LOCKE: Wrap this in plastic, you don't want it to get wet. We're taking the outrigger.

[Sayid takes the gun and walks away. Locke notices Claire watching him.]

LOCKE: Something wrong, Claire?

CLAIRE: Um... what you said to Jin... about the names on the wall? Told him you needed them all to get off the island?

LOCKE: Yes I did.

CLAIRE: So... was my name on the wall?

LOCKE: No.

CLAIRE: Then... it doesn't matter if I get on that plane then. You don't need me--

LOCKE: No. That's not true, Claire. I need you. And there's plenty of room on that plane for all of us.

CLAIRE: When we go home, Aaron's not going to know me. Stranger to my own son. He thinks Kate's his mother. Was her name on the wall?

LOCKE: No, Claire... it isn't. Not anymore. But I need Kate.

CLAIRE: Why?

LOCKE: Because I'm three people shy of getting off this island and Kate can help me get those people on the plane. But... once she does... then whatever happens, happens.

[Locke gets up and walks away, Sayid joins him.]

SAWYER: What's up with the guns? You two goin' somewhere?

LOCKE: We're taking a boat ride over to the other island.

SAWYER: What do you need a boat for? Can't you just turn into smoke and fly your ass over the water?

LOCKE: Do you think if I could do that I would still be on this island?

SAWYER: No, 'cause that would be ridiculous... what the hell are you goin' over there for anyway? Thought you were tryin' to avoid Charlie Widmore.

LOCKE: They took one of our people, James. So I'm going to get him back.

[Flash-sideways timeline. Keamy enters the hotel bedroom. Sun hands him a box which he opens to find a watch.]

KEAMY: Is this for me? Wow this is really nice. Hmm. Your bodyguard is supposed to give me some money. Where's Mr. Kwon?

SUN: No English.

[There is a knock on the door.]

KEAMY: Sit down.

[He opens the door, Omar enters.]

OMAR: I checked his room, he's not there.

KEAMY: Check the bathroom.

[He opens the door and sees Jin.]

OMAR: Come on, let's go.

KEAMY: Mr Kwon! Why don't you come and join us? Look, thank you for the watch, okay, but you're also supposed to give me an envelope with money in it. Twenty-five thousand dollars.

JIN [subtitled]: What can we do?

SUN [subtitled]: We'll give him some of our money.

JIN [subtitled]: You want us to pay him?

KEAMY: [inaudible mumbling imitating Korean] Stop it. I feel like I'm in a damn Godzilla movie. What's that guy's name, the Russian guy, speaks like nine different languages, Danny's friend?

OMAR: Mikhail.

KEAMY: Mikhail. He speak Korean?

OMAR: Think so.

KEAMY: Go get him. [to Sun] Now put your damn clothes on.

[Some time later in the hotel room, Mikhail is present.]

SUN [subtitled]: The money was confiscated at customs. But I have money.

MIKHAIL: She says the money her father gave them was taken at customs.

KEAMY: That's not my problem.

SUN [subtitled]: Let us go to the bank, and I'll give it to you.

MIKHAIL: She wants you to let them please go to the bank, they will get it for you.

[Keamy takes a moment to think.]

KEAMY: You take her to the bank, and I'll take Casanova here to the restaurant, then we'll meet there.

MIKHAIL [subtitled]: He'll take Jin to the restaurant.

JIN [subtitled]: Please, you must promise not to tell Mr. Paik about us. Please.

KEAMY: What's he whining about?

MIKHAIL: He wants you to promise that you won't tell her father that they are involved.

KEAMY: Oh. Hey, don't worry about that. Okay, your secret, it's safe with me. Okay? Just bring me the money and then we could all live happily ever after, right?

[Mikhail leads Sun towards the door.]

[Original timeline. Jack is examining Sun's head injury. Ilana has a suspicous look on her face.]

BEN: What? Oh, for the fourth time, I was gathering mangoes and she was already unconcious when I found her. Why won't you believe me?

ILANA: Because you're speaking.

JACK: You gotta a pretty descent size bump, it might be a slight concussion. You can understand what I'm saying?(sun nods)But, you can only speak Korean.

SUN: [Subtitled] That's right.

MILES: She hits her head and forgets English? Are we supposed to buy that?

FRANK: Asks the man who communes with the dead.

JACK: It might be aphasia. It's um, a condition that's caused by trauma and it affects the language center of your brain. It's usually temporary. Sun, You're gonna be okay.

[Ilana smiles.]

MILES: What are you smiling about?

[We see Richard walk toward them with Hurley.]

RICHARD: Pack your bags, we're leaving.

[On Hydra Island, we see Locke get off a canoe and walk toward the sonic pylons. There is gunfire. Widmore's men jump out of the bushes.]

MEN: DOWN LOW!!

SEAMUS: Let me see your hands!

LOCKE: [shows his hands] Easy, friend, I come in peace.

[Locke walks to his left and he sees Widmore.]

WIDMORE: Do you know who I am?

LOCKE: Charles Widmore. Do you know who I am?

WIDMORE: Obviously you're not John Locke. Everything else I know is a combination of myth, ghost stories, and jungle noises in the night.

LOCKE: I think you know more than that judging by these pylons.

WIDMORE: Why did you come here?

LOCKE: You took one of my people, Jin Kwon.

WIDMORE: I have no idea what you're talking about.

[There is a pause.]

LOCKE: A wise man once said that war was coming to this island, I think it just got here.

[On the beach Richard and Jack talk.]

JACK: Where exactly are we going, Richard?

RICHARD: Where's Locke?

BEN: What?

RICHARD: You said he came to recruit you. Where did he say he'd be?

BEN: Hydra island.

RICHARD: Which is exactly where you landed the plane that you flew back here, right?

FRANK: That's right.

RICHARD: This man wants to leave the island, and that plane's the only way he can do it. You wanna know where we're going, we're gonna stop him.

MILES: This is your fault isn't it?

HURLEY: Sorta.

ILANA: How are we gonna stop him from getting on the plane?

RICHARD: We have to destroy it.

SUN: [subtitled] What? You want to destroy the plane? How are we supposed to get off the island?

RICHARD: Why isn't she speaking English?

JACK: She was hit on the head when she was running away from Locke.

RICHARD: He came back here?

[Jack nods.]

RICHARD: What, what did he want? What did he say to you? Do you understand me?

SUN: Yes, I understand, you idiot-- but if you think I'm gonna help you destroy our only way off this island, you're insane! I came here to find my husband so I could bring him home, not so I could save the damn world! She says I'm important.(points to Ilana) If that's true, you need me! So, "understand" this! I'm not going anywhere.

[Sun walks away furiously.]

HURLEY: I don't think she wants to come.

[Flash-sideways timeline. Sun and Mikhail are at the bank, a bank clerk is looking up the account details.]

SUN [subtitled]: Is there a problem?

MIKHAIL: Miss Paik would like to know if there is a problem.

BANK CLERK: I'm sorry, I'm showing that your account was closed. The balance is zero.

MIKHAIL [subtitled]: She says your account is closed.

SUN [subtitled]: No, that can't be right. No one knows it exists but me.

MIKHAIL: If she may ask, who closed the account please?

BANK CLERK: Looks like her father, Mr Woo-Jung Paik had access. The funds were transferred to one of his other accounts at our main branch in Seoul.

MIKHAIL [subtitled]: Your father closed the account.

SUN [subtitled]: Why...would he do that?

MIKHAIL [subtitled]: Why do you think?

[Flash-sideways timeline. At the restaurant, Omar pushes Jin into the freezer room and ties him up in a chair.]

OMAR: Get in.

[Keamy appears in the doorway.]

KEAMY: What's going on?

OMAR: I bumped his head on the door.

KEAMY: Come on Omar, you gotta be more careful than that.

[Keamy gets a damp cloth fromt the kitchen, and returns.]

KEAMY: I got this. You go get the Arab guy.

OMAR: Hey...I'm an Arab.

KEAMY: Just go pick him up

[Omar leaves.]

KEAMY: Sorry about that. Omar is loyal but he lacks attention to detail. You don't really understand a word I'm saying to you right now, do you? Nothing? Right. Just hold still okay. I'm gonna strap you in here just in case you figure out what's about to happen to you, I can't have you freaking out. I don't think you realise how unhappy Mr. Paik was when he found out that you were doing his little girl. That other twenty five that you were supposed to deliver, that was my fee for popping you. From what I hear, now anyone who works for Mr. Paik knows the cardinal rule - hands off the boss's daughter. But you, you couldn't resist her, could you? The heart wants what the heart wants.

JIN: Thank you.

KEAMY: I'm sorry. Some people just aren't meant to be together.

[Keamy shuts the freezer door.]
