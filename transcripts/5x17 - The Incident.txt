LOCKE: What is it? Why are we stopping?

RICHARD: You'll see.

LOCKE: Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard, but what does it have to do with Jacob?

RICHARD: It's where he lives.

[Slides open van door]

JACK: What's going on, Kate?

SAWYER: Doc, we gotta talk.

JACK: You wanna talk? Then get in the van. We don't have time--

SAWYER: I ain't gettin' in the van. I need five minutes, that's all. I'll say what I gotta say, and then you can do whatever the hell you want to. But you're gonna listen. You owe me that much, Jack.

JACK: Five minutes.

[Monitor beeping steadily]

[Monitor continues beeping steadily]

[squish]

[panting]

NURSE: Dr. Shephard? You all right?

JACK: The dural sac--I cut it.

[Monitor continues beeping steadily]

JACK: Give me some suction.

CHRISTIAN: Calm down. It's all right.

JACK: The fluid's leaking everywhere. I can't--

CHRISTIAN: Look at me.

JACK: Give me some suction.

WOMAN: Yes, doctor.

CHRISTIAN: Jack... look at me. Count to five.

JACK: What are you talking about?

CHRISTIAN: I'm talking about you stitching up the sac so this girl isn't paralyzed for the rest of her life. And the only way you're gonna do that is not to be afraid. So close your eyes, count to five, and then fix her, Jack. Or I'll have to fix her for you.

[Monitor continues beeping steadily]

JACK: One... [sighs] two... three... four... five. Sutures.

[Coin clinks]

[Beeping]

[Whirring]

[Machine beeps]

[Rattles]

[sighs]

[woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.]

CHRISTIAN: Hey, kiddo. Girl's in recovery. She's responsive to stimulus below the waist, so... no paralysis.

JACK: Good.

CHRISTIAN: Something wrong, Jack?

JACK: You embarrassed me.

CHRISTIAN: Did I?

JACK: You know, it's bad enough that everybody in this hospital thinks the only reason I got this residency is because you're my father. But then you... [sighs] you put me in a time-out during my first major procedure, in front of my entire team. [Sighs] Dad, I know you don't believe in me, but I need them to.

CHRISTIAN: Are you sure I'm the one who doesn't believe in you, Jack?

[Coins clink, machine beeps]

JACOB: One of these yours?

JACK: [Sighs] Machine got stuck.

JACOB: I guess it just needed a little push.

SAWYER: Take a load off, Doc.

JACK: No, thanks.

SAWYER: Sit down, Jack.

[Birds chirping]

[exhales deeply]

SAWYER: My folks died when I was 8 years old. I ever tell you that?

JACK: No.

SAWYER: Con man took my dad for everything he had. He didn't deal with it very well. He shot my mom, then he blew his own head off. I was hiding under the bed when it happened. I heard the whole thing.

JACK: I'm sorry.

SAWYER: Yeah. That was a year ago.

JACK: What?

SAWYER: Right now it's July 1977, which means that happened last year. So I could've hopped on the sub, gone back to the States, walked right in my house and stopped my daddy from killing anybody.

JACK: Why didn't you?

SAWYER: Because, Jack... what's done is done.

JACK: It doesn't have to be that way.

SAWYER: What did you screw up so bad the first time around you're willing to blow up a damn nuke just for a second chance?

JACK: That's not what this is about.

SAWYER: Then what is it about?

JACK: Three years ago, Locke told me that all this was happening for a reason, that us being here was our destiny.

SAWYER: I don't speak "destiny". What I do understand is a man does what he does 'cause he wants something for himself. What do you want, Jack?

JACK: I had her. I had her, and I lost her.

SAWYER: Kate? Well, damn, Doc, she's standing right on the other side of those trees. You want her back, just go and ask her.

JACK: Nah, it's too late for that. Your five minutes is up.

SAWYER: Jack... if what you're doin' even works, you and Kate will be strangers, and she'll be in damn handcuffs.

JACK: If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

SAWYER: Well, I guess there's nothing I can say that's gonna change your mind.

JACK: No, I guess there's not.

[Both grunt]

SAWYER: Who the hell do you think you are?!

[Both grunting]

[Spits]

SAWYER: You think you can come here and do whatever the hell you want? I had a life here!

[Both grunting]

[Groans]

JACK: Sawyer...

[grunts]

[groans]

[both grunting]

SAWYER: Will you stop?

[Groans]

SAWYER: Will you stop?!

JACK: No.

Aah! [Grunting]

JULIET: James! Let him go.

SAWYER: He wouldn't listen. I had to. He won't stop!

[Coughs]

JULIET: That's because he's right.

SAWYER: What?!

JULIET: He's right, James. We have to do this.

SAWYER: What are you talking about?! You're the one that told me to come back here and stop him! What happened?!

JULIET: I changed my mind. 

MOTHER: Girls... your dad and I have something we need to talk to you both about.

BLONDE SISTER: Are we moving again?

BRUNETTE SISTER: No, stupid. They're getting a divorce.

MOTHER: Rachel--

RACHEL: Well, aren't you?

MOTHER: Yes. But... we need you both to understand that your father and I... we still love each other. Just because two people love each other, doesn't always mean they're supposed to be together.

BLONDE SISTER: But what if you are supposed to be together?

MOTHER: We're not, honey.

BLONDE SISTER: But how can you know for sure?

MOTHER: We just know.

[The blonde sister cries.]

MOTHER: And when you're a grown-up, you'll understand.

BLONDE SISTER: I don't wanna understand!

MOTHER: Juliet, wait!

JULIET: I don't wanna understand!

SAWYER: Stop! We gotta talk about this!

JULIET: There's nothing to talk about, James. We have to let Jack do what he came here to do.

SAWYER: Well, maybe you shoulda told me you had a change of heart before I brought him out in the jungle to kick his ass.

JULIET: Would that have stopped you?

SAWYER: No.

JULIET: Well, then I'm glad you finally got it out of your system.

SAWYER: Hey! Hey!

JULIET: You, don't.

SAWYER: I need you to tell me where all this is coming from. I mean, one minute, you're leading the great sub escape, and now you're on board with blowing up the damn Island? I got a right to know why you changed your mind.

[Panting]

JULIET: I changed my mind when I saw you look at her. Don't. Don't. [Whispers] Don't. Don't.

SAWYER: I don't care who I looked at. I'm with you.

JULIET: And you would stay with me forever if I let you, and that is why I will always love you.

SAWYER: You don't--

JULIET: What we had, it was just for a little while, and just because we love each other, it doesn't mean that we're meant to be together. I mean, maybe we were never supposed to be together. So if Jack can make it that--that none of you ever come here, then he should.

SAWYER: Why you doing this, Juliet?

JULIET: [Voice breaks] I... if I never meet you, then I never have to lose you.

[Drilling]

[both speaking indistinctly]

DR. CHANG: Radzinsky!

RADZINSKY: What is it now?!

DR. CHANG: The gauss readings has jumped off the charts.

RADZINSKY: Let me see. This is it! We're on top of the pocket!

DR. CHANG: If we keep drilling and hit that pocket, all hell is gonna break loose!

PHIL: Radzinsky, are you there? Over. Stuart, come in!

RADZINSKY: What do you want, Phil?

PHIL: That Hostile that shot the kid? He came back.

RADZINSKY: What the hell are you talking about?

PHIL: Here at the Barracks. He--he attacked us and then got rescued by some of the other recruits. They stole a van and took off.

RADZINSKY: Took off where?

PHIL: I don't know, but Roger said that one of them had a bomb.

RADZINSKY: That Hostile knows about the Swan! Get some men and some guns, and get your asses out here right now! If they're coming here, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

RADZINSKY: Co

KATE: Jack? What happened?

JACK: Uh... [sighs] Yeah, my talk with Sawyer didn't go so good. [Chuckles]

KATE: Does it hurt?

JACK: Ah, it's okay.

KATE: Okay.

[Drilling continues]

[birds chirping]

KATE: Do you remember when I sewed you up? When we first got here?

JACK: Yeah. [Chuckles] Seems like a million years ago.

KATE: Or 30 years from now.

[Jack chuckles]

JACK: Kate, why'd you make me promise to never ask about Aaron?

KATE: Because I was... so angry with you for making me come back here.

JACK: Is he why you came back?

KATE: I came back so he could be where he belongs--with his mother.

JACK: If this works, Claire will never come to the island, and they'll always be together, just the way they're meant to be.

KATE: She was gonna give him up for adoption, Jack.'

JACK: Well, you don't know what she would do. And whatever it is, it would be her choice. If you wanna save Claire, this is the only way to do it. Nothing... nothing in my life has ever felt so right. And... [sighs] I just need you to believe that.

[Loud creaking, crash]

Go!

Keep going!

[Alarm blaring]

RADZINSKY: Keep the drill going!

JACK: It's about to happen. Are you with me on this?

KATE: Yes.

JACK: Then let's go. 

[Man shouts indistinctly]

MAN: Copy that.

JAIL CLERK: One wallet. $227 cash. One ballpoint pen. [Clicks] One fruit roll-up. Sign here.

[Lays down pen]

HURLEY: You don't understand. This is a big mistake. I killed a bunch of people.

JAIL CLERK: You see this? This is a discharge form. You've been cleared. So take your stuff and go.

HURLEY: Look, dude... there are men with tranquilizer guns hunting me down like an animal. They wanna bring me somewhere against my will.

JAIL CLERK: There's a cab stand right out front.

HURLEY: Oh. Sorry. I didn't see it was taken, dude.

JACOB: Actually, I'm only going a few blocks if you wanna share.

HURLEY: Cool. Are you sure?

JACOB: Come on in.

HURLEY: You want some? Cherry.

JACOB: No thanks.

[Wrapper crinkles]

HURLEY: So what were you in for?

[Rips wrapper]

JACOB: Excuse me?

HURLEY: Jail. I was there 'cause I killed three people. But I didn't really. I guess they figured it out. What about you?

JACOB: I wasn't in jail.

HURLEY: Well, then what were you doing sitting outside a prison? In a cab?

JACOB: I was waitin' for you, Hugo.

HURLEY: Oh. Then you must be dead.

JACOB: I'm definitely not dead.

HURLEY: Well, what do you want from me?

JACOB: I wanna know why you won't go back to the Island.

HURLEY: 'Cause I'm cursed.

JACOB: Is that so?

HURLEY: Uh-huh. That's why the plane crashed, my friends died--Libby, Charlie. Now they visit me, and I can't make it stop.

JACOB: Well, what if you weren't cursed? What if you were blessed?

HURLEY: How do you mean "blessed?"

JACOB: Well, you get to talk to people you've lost... seems like a pretty wonderful thing to me.

HURLEY: Oh, I'm sure it's wonderful, except for the part where I'm crazy.

JACOB: [Clicks tongue] I've got some news for you, Hugo, and you're just gonna have to take my word on this. You are not crazy.

HURLEY: Who are you, dude?

JACOB: [To the cab driver] I'm just up here on the corner.

[The cab driver nods.]

JACOB: [To Hurley] Ajira Airways Flight 316 out of LAX. Leaves in 24 hours. All you have to do is get on that plane. It's your choice, Hugo. You don't have to do anything you don't want to.

HURLEY: Wait! You forgot your guitar.

JACOB: It's not my guitar.

HURLEY: Don't worry, dude. Everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future... or the past. One of those.

MILES: I don't think your buddy's gonna make it.

JIN: He'll make it.

[Jack returns to the van.]

HURLEY: Dude, what happened to your face?

JACK: Nothin'. We were just up on a ridge where we could look down into the Swan site.

[Drops bag]

JACK: Something just happened down there.

[Removes objects]

They hit something. It's time for me to go.

SAYID: It's all set to go. Remember, be careful. It's rigged to explode on impact. According to Faraday's plan, you must get the bomb as close as you can to the source of electromagnetism.

JACK: [Sighs] Sayid, this is gonna work. And it'll save ya.

SAYID: Nothing can save me.

[Exhales deeply]

[sighs deeply]

JACK: See ya in Los Angeles.

[Surf rolling]

[indistinct conversations]

RICHARD: Are you sure you need to do this? If you waited, Jacob would eventually come to you, John.

LOCKE: I'm tired of waiting. Where is he, Richard?

SUN: What happened to the rest of the statue?

BEN: I don't know. It was like that when I got here.

SUN: Do you expect me to believe that?

BEN: Not really.

LOCKE: All right, Ben, let's go.

RICHARD: W--what are you doing?

BEN: John wants me to join him.

RICHARD: You can't bring him in.

LOCKE: Why not?

RICHARD: Because only our leader can request an audience with Jacob, and there can only be one leader on the Island at a time, John.

LOCKE: I'm beginning to think you just make these rules up as you go along, Richard. Ben is coming in with me, and if that's a problem, I'm sure Jacob and I can work it out.

[Stone scraping]

RICHARD: Tell him I said hello.

[Stone scraping]

LOCKE: Will you be able to do this, Ben? I know it won't be easy, but things will change... [whispers] once he's gone. I promise.

[Whoosh]

[Ripping sound]

MILES: Can I ask you something, LaFleur?

SAWYER: There ain't no more LaFleur, Enos. Go ahead, shoot.

MILES: Has it occurred to any of you that your buddy's actually gonna cause the thing he says he's trying to prevent? Perhaps that little nuke is the incident? So maybe the best thing to do... is nothing?

[]

MILES: I'm glad you all thought this through.

[Vehicle approaching]

JULIET: What's going on?

JIN: It's Phil. That's the road to the Swan.

KATE: If they see Jack, they're gonna kill him.

SAWYER: What do you think, Blondie?

JULIET: Live together, die alone.

[Alarm continues blaring, man shouting indistinctly]

[Man speaks indistinctly]

RADZINSKY: Good for you. You got here fast.

PHIL: Any sign of 'em yet?

RADZINSKY: No, not yet. You got time to set up a perimeter.

DR. CHANG: You called these men to the site?

You, rear ridgeline. You, top ridgeline.

DR. CHANG: We need to be getting people away from here!

You, top of the scaffolding. Go now!

[Alarm continues blaring]

There!

[Gunshots ricochet]

[Man shouts indistinctly]

Get him!

Flank him! Get him now!

[Vehicle approaches]

Who's this?!

[Gunfire continues]

Uhh!

[Gunshots ricocheting]

[Gunshots ricocheting]

Aah!

SAWYER: Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man!

PHIL: Okay, okay.

SAWYER: Tell 'em to put their guns down.

PHIL: [Shouting] Drop the guns! Drop the guns!

[Drilling continues]

SAWYER: All right, you can come out now, Doc!

[Cocks gun]

SAWYER: Hurry up and do your business.

[Alarm continues blaring]

Turn that damn thing off!

[Clicking]

[Drilling continues]

What's the matter?!

[Clicking]

[hisses]

DR. CHANG: It won't shut down!

SAWYER: Why not?!

DR. CHANG: Something's pulling the drill down.

RADZINSKY: We hit the pocket!

SAWYER: Hurry up, Doc! What are you waiting for?! Drop it!

[Drilling continues]

[panting]

SAWYER: [Sighs] This don't look like LAX.

[Metal clanking and banging

[Loudly]

[buzzing, magnetic humming]

[hissing]

[metal rattling]

[metal creaking]

DR. CHANG: Aah!

MILES: Dad!

DR. CHANG: Aah!

[Loud clank]

Uhh!

Jack!

MILES: Dad!

[Clatter]

MILES: Get away from here! Get as far away from here as you can!

RADZINSKY: Get in!

What the hell's going on?!

Get out of here!

Come on!

Go! Go! Go!

[Metal creaks]

[screaming]

Hey, LaFleur!

[Grunts]

Aah! Help!

Help!

Juliet!

Ah, come on!

JULIET: Sawyer! Help!

Juliet!

[Grunts] Sawyer!

[Grunts] Aah!

Uhh!

Aah!

[Screaming]

SAWYER: Where do you think you're going, Blondie?

[Gasps] Aah!

SAWYER: Kate! Help me get those chains off!

[Grunts]

[Whimpers]

SAWYER: Hold on! You hold on!

JULIET: [Crying] I can't.

I can't get it off.

SAWYER: I got you.

JULIET: [Grunts] I can't...

[metal creaking]

SAWYER: Aah! Juliet! No!

[Sobbing]

KATE: I can't reach her.

SAWYER: You hold on!

Aah!

No!

[Cries]

I got you.

[Creaking]

KATE: Sawyer!

SAWYER: Don't you leave me.

JULIET: [Panting] It's okay.

SAWYER: Don't you leave me!

JULIET: [Sobbing] I love you.

SAWYER: No, you don't let go!

JULIET: I love you, James.

SAWYER: Don't let go.

JULIET: I love you so much.

SAWYER: No! No, don't let go!

Aah!

SAWYER: Juliet! No!

[Sobbing] 

RICHARD: Water?

SUN: Do you have any alcohol?

RICHARD: [Chuckles] No. Sure wish I did.

[Guns cock]

ILANA: Don't shoot.

RICHARD: It's okay. It's all right.

ILANA: Which one of you is Ricardus?

RICHARD: It's Richard, actually.

ILANA: What lies in the shadow of the statue?

RICHARD: Ille qui nos omnes servabit.

ILANA: Richard... I'm Ilana. I have something you need to see. [Shouting, to her team] Open it up.

[The Others cock their guns]

RICHARD: It--it's okay. It's okay. Let them.

RICHARD: Where did you find him?

ILANA: In the cargo hold of the plane we came here on... in a coffin.

SUN: I don't understand. If this is Locke... who's in there?

JACOB: You like it? I did it myself. It takes a very long time when you're making the thread, but, uh... I suppose that's the point, isn't it?

LOCKE: Hello, Jacob.

JACOB: Well, you found your loophole.

LOCKE: Indeed I did. And you have no idea what I've gone through to be here.

BEN: Have you met before?

LOCKE: In a manner of speaking. [Whispers] Do what I asked you to, Ben.

JACOB: Benjamin... whatever he's told you, I want you to understand one thing. You have a choice.

BEN: What "choice"?

JACOB: You can do what he asked, or you can go, leave us to discuss our... issues.

BEN: Oh... so now, after all this time, you've decided to stop ignoring me. Thirty-five years I lived on this island, and all I ever heard was your name over and over. Richard would bring me your instructions--all those slips of paper, all those lists--and I never questioned anything. I did as I was told. But when I dared to ask to see you myself, I was told, "You have to wait. You have to be patient." But when he asked to see you? He gets marched straight up here as if was Moses. So... why him? Hmm? What was it that was so wrong with me? What about me?!

JACOB: What about you?

BEN: [Whispers] Oh. [Normal voice] Well...

[grunts]

[pants]

JACOB: [Gagging] they're coming.

LOCKE: What?

[Jacob gags.]

LOCKE: I can't hear you.

JACOB: They're coming.

SAWYER: Juliet!

[Buzzing and humming continues]

KATE: Sawyer, get off of there!

[Metal continues creaking]

KATE: we have to go right now. We need to go!

[Groans]

Get off.

KATE: It's going down! This thing is gonna go! You have to let it go.

KATE: You have to go. This thing is going to blow at any second.

SAWYER: No!

KATE: Jack! Jack, help me get him off.

[Buzzing and humming continues]

[Loud crashing]

[Gasps]

[Coughing]

[Wheezes]

[Whimpers]

[Breathing rapidly]

[Crying]

[Groans]

[Coughing]

[Buzzing and humming continues]

[Thud]

[Groans] Come on! [Sobbing] Come on! No! Come on! Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!

[Loud explosion]
