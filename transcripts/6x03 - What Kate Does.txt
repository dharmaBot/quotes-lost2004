[bare feet slapping against concrete, panting]

[Lennon jogs through the temple]

[door slams open]

[Lennon enters Dogen's quarters]

LENNON: He's alive.

[Dogen does not reply, his expression unreadable, he clasps the pendant around his neck]

[At the spring, Jack kneels next to Sayid and smiles]

HURLEY: It worked? Dude! You're okay!

[Hurley kneels and hugs Sayid]

JACK: Hurley, let him breathe. Miles, can you go get some water?

[Miles stares at Sayid in confusion]

MILES: Yeah... on it...

[Miles exits]

JACK: Sayid? Hey... how are you feeling?

SAYID: A little light-headed...

[Jack chuckles]

[Jin crouches nearby and stares]

SAYID: Jack? What happened to me?

JACK: You died.

[Kate and Sawyer watch from a distance]

KATE: How is that even possible? I mean... one minute he's gone and now he's fine?

SAWYER: Of course he's fine.

KATE: What does that mean?

SAWYER: He's an Iraqi torturer who shoots kids, he definitely deserves another go around.

[Jack, Hurley, and Jin help Sayid up]

[Sawyer stares outside]

KATE: What are you lookin' at?

SAWYER: How many guys with guns you think are outside this place?

KATE: What?

SAWYER: I was out cold when they brought me in here. How many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?

KATE: What are you thinking?

SAWYER: I'm thinkin' about runnin', Kate.

[Kate walks outside the airport, stops as she spots Mars speaking to security]

EDWARD MARS: She's got handcuffs on but she's probably got them covered, okay?

[Mars sees Kate through the crowd]

EDWARD MARS: Hey!

[Kate runs, Mars bumps into a man as he gives chase]

MAN: Hey, watch it!

[Kate climbs into a taxi]

KATE: Go! Go now!

DRIVER: Lady, I already have a customer.

[Kate points a gun at his head]

KATE: Damn it, I said go!

DRIVER: Okay!

[Tires squeal]

KATE: Easy! Easy! Slow down! Hey! Just slow down! Slow down!

DRIVER: Okay! Okay! You said go!

KATE: Just get us out of here...

[Mars sees the cab]

EDWARD MARS: Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

[He hits the trunk as the cab passes]

CLAIRE: Please, please just let me out--

KATE: Be quiet!

[Kate points the gun at Claire]

[The driver is distracted by a nearby police cruiser and almost hits a man picking up his luggage in the crosswalk]

[Brakes squeal, horns honk]

KATE: What are you doing?

DRIVER: There's a guy.

KATE: Move!

DRIVER: I'm not gonna run him over!

[The man in the crosswalk, Arzt, turns and sees the cab]

ARZT: Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!

[Arzt continues picking up his spilled luggage]

[Kate notices Jack standing nearby and they exchange a bizarre glance]

[Claire opens her door and attempts to flee the cab, Kate wrestles her back in]

KATE: Do not get out of this car!

[Kate turns to the driver]

KATE: Just go. Go! Now! I don't care about the guy, go!

DRIVER: Okay...

[The cab goes forward, dragging a piece of Arzt's luggage along with it]

ARZT: Hey! Hey! What the hell? Hey, I got your license plate!

[The cab approaches an intersection as the light turns red]

KATE: At the light, take a left.

[The cab driver watches Kate in the rear view mirror]

CLAIRE: Can you... c-can you please, please just let me go? I promise I won't say anything to anyone--

[The cab driver quickly opens his door and runs into the street]

KATE: Hey! Hey!

[Kate sighs]

KATE: Damn it!

[She climbs into the driver's seat and speeds away]

[Tires squealing]

[Another car almost collides with them in the intersection]

[Brakes squealing, horn honking]

KATE: Give me your purse!

CLAIRE: But I... I--

KATE: I said give me your purse!

[Claire sobs as she hands over the purse]

[Kate slams on the brakes]

KATE: Now get out of the car.

CLAIRE: Can I please just... just get my suitcase--

KATE: No, you can't! Get out of the car!

[Sobbing, Claire exits the car]

[Kate peels away from the curb]

[Kate walks out of the temple into a yard]

[Jack and Jin help Sayid into the yard]

JACK: Easy...

[They lower Sayid into a sitting position]

[Hurley follows behind, Miles approaches with some water]

SAYID: Who are these people? What do they want?

HURLEY: It's the Others, dude. They caught us. Again. I don't know, I think they're... trying to protect us.

MILES: Yeah, and as you can see, Hugo here has assumed the... leadership position, so... that's pretty great.

[Sayid notices Jack staring at his abdomen]

SAYID: What?

JACK: The wound. It's almost completely closed.

[Jack lifts Sayid's shirt, Sayid examines his wound]

SAYID: Thank you, Jack.

JACK: For what?

SAYID: Saving my life.

[Doors slam]

[Jack stands as Dogen and Lennon enter the yard, accompanied by some Others]

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese] Naniwatomoare isogunda(何はともあれ急ぐんだ―Anyway, hurry up.)

LENNON: Mr. Jarrah, will you come with us please?

SAYID: Come with you where?

LENNON: Inside. Nothing to worry about, we just--

JACK: I'm coming with him.

LENNON: Oh, I'm sorry, we need to talk to him alone. Just a few questions...

JACK: You have a few questions? Well, so do we. I mean let's start with, who are you? Why are you holding us here? You--

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese] Kono otoko wo damarasero(この男を黙らせろ―Let this man shut up.)

LENNON: Once we've spoken to Mr. Jarrah we will be more than happy to tell you everything you want to know.

JACK: Something tells me... that you're not gonna be happy to tell us anything.

[Jack and Dogen stare at one another]

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese] Tsureteike(連れて行け―Take them.)

[The Others attack, wrestling with Jack and striking Miles]

[The sounds of the struggle are interrupted by gunshots]

[The Others take aim at Sawyer, who has stolen a pistol]

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese] Yamero(やめろ―Stop it.)

LENNON: Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!

[The Others comply, Lennon approaches Sawyer]

LENNON: Please. You don't have to do this. We won't hurt your friend...

SAWYER: He ain't my friend. Do what you want with him. And anybody else. But me? I'm walkin' outta here.

KATE: James...

SAWYER: I'm gone! You understand?

DOGEN: Please... you have to stay.

SAWYER: No. I don't.

[He removes the barricade and steps through the door, Kate stares at him]

SAWYER: Don't come after me.

[He slams the door shut]

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese] Nani wo shitemo kamawan.(何をしても構わん―You may take any kind of measure.)Ford wo tsuremodose.(フォードを連れ戻せ―Take Ford back.)

[Some Others carry Sayid into the temple, more of them restrain Jack]

JACK: Hey! Hey! Where're they taking Sayid?

[Aldo enters the yard]

ALDO: Hey! Calm down! Everybody calm down!

[Aldo points a gun at Jack]

LENNON: Where'd Ford go?

JACK: What?

LENNON: Ford. Your friend who just ran out of here. Where did he go?

JACK: I don't know.

LENNON: You expect me to believe that?

JACK: He told me he wanted to kill me. Do you believe that?

KATE: I can bring him back.

LENNON: You know where he went?

KATE: No, but I can track him. Let me go, I will bring him back, and I can make him stay.

JACK: Kate? You sure you want to go out there alone with these people?

JIN: I'll go with her.

LENNON: It's very important that he gets back here safely. What makes you think he's going to listen to you?

KATE: I can be very convincing when I want to be.

[Radio playing, belt sander grinding]

[Kate pulls up to a garage and approaches a mechanic with her gun drawn]

KATE: Where's your tire hammer?

[The mechanic shuts off his tool and removes his safety glasses]

MECHANIC: You got a problem.

KATE: So do you. Where's your tire hammer?

MECHANIC: A tire hammer will just cut off your wrists. Your problem is you need a punch press. And you're not going to be able to use one of those and keep that gun pointed at me.

KATE: You volunteering? [lowers gun]

MECHANIC: I got a steady hand but I kinda feel like we got on the wrong foot.

KATE: [smiles] I'll give you two hundred dollars.

MECHANIC: Now hold still. [Mechanic takes the cuffs off]

KATE: [sighs] Thanks.

MECHANIC: So why the bracelets?

KATE: I'm wanted for murder.

MECHANIC: Murder?

KATE: You don't have somewhere I can change do you?

MECHANIC: [Laughs] Bathroom's over there; make it quick.

KATE: Thank you. [goes to bathroom]

[Kate opens Claire's bag, finds a picture of Claire obviously pregnant, and a stuffed black & white whale - she looks pensively into the mirror]

[Back at the temple, Kate is packing her bag for the trip]

ALDO: [Hands her something] Better not slow us down.

KATE: Better not slow me down.

[Jack comes and sits next to Kate.]

JACK: I would go with you, but um-

KATE: Sawyer would kill you?

[Jack chuckles]

KATE: I'll take care of James; you take care of Sayid. [Jack nods]

JACK: Deal.

[both standing up]

KATE: Goodbye. [Jack grabs Kate's elbow]

JACK: Be careful.

[Kate stares at Jack, slightly smiles, then walks out of the room]

[Sayid is strapped to a table; Dogen is standing near him]

SAYID: What is it you want? Please, whatever your thinking of doing.

[Dogen puts some ash(?) in his hand, and blows it over Sayid's chest, looking for a reaction]

SAYID: What is that?

[Dogen hooks some electrical wires to Sayid's chest]

SAYID: Just tell me what you want.

[Dogen electrocutes Sayid, who screams in pain]

[Dogen clips off the wires]

SAYID: Why? Why are you doing this?

[Dogen grabs a hot poker]

SAYID: I don't have any secrets.

[Dogen presses the poker on his chest, Sayid screams in pain]

DOGEN: [Japanese]Yoshi kore de jyuubun da(よしこれで十分だ―All right.That's enough.)Shiken ni tootta to omoe(試験に通ったと思え―Think you pass the exam.)

LENNON: I'm sorry we had to put you through that. [Free Sayid] It was a test. We had to be sure.

SAYID: Test to be sure of what?

LENNON: Don't worry, you passed.

[Others walk Sayid out of the room]

LENNON: I just lied to him, didn't I?

DOGEN: Yes.

[the cab Kate stole pulls up to the curb where Claire is sitting on a bench - Claire looks nervous]

KATE: Where were you going?

CLAIRE: What?

KATE: Before I got in the cab, where were you going?

CLAIRE: Why, so you can hijack them too?

[Kate gets Claire's stuff out the trunk]

CLAIRE: I was waiting for a bus.

KATE: Came to bring you your stuff. [hands bags to Claire] Relax, I didn't take your money.

CLAIRE: Well, um, gee thanks.

KATE: So where were you going?

CLAIRE: Don't worry about it.

KATE: [in resignation] ...fine. [She turns to get back in the cab]

CLAIRE: Langdon Street, Brentwood.

KATE: You got family there?

CLAIRE: Ah, no - it's a... couple who's adopting my baby. They were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport but I guess they got their days mixed up or something. It's not like they abandoned me.

KATE: Brentwood's not far, get in.

CLAIRE: Seriously?

KATE: Do you want a ride or not?

[Claire reluctantly gets into the cab with Kate]

[Kate and Jin along with Justin and Aldo are walking through the jungle]

KATE: So why do you people want us to stay at the temple?

ALDO: We're protecting you.

KATE: From what?

ALDO: You been on this island a while, right? Ever see a big pillar of black smoke, makes a tikka-tikka sound, looks pissed off?

KATE: Yes.

ALDO: From that.

JIN: Do you know anything about another plane coming in? An Ajira flight?

ALDO: I'm sorry, is this a press conference?

JUSTIN: I think he means the one that landed in--

ALDO: Justin! Shut up.

KATE: Nonono that's a decoy trail, he went this way.

ALDO: And you're basing this on what?

KATE: Experience!

JUSTIN: Aldo.

ALDO: What?

JUSTIN: I think she's right.

ALDO: Of course she is. After you princess.

[they all follow Kate]

ALDO: So what's your strategy for bringing your boyfriend back - I hope you got one because he shot a guy on his way out - and if he try's that on me I'm gonna blow his head off.

[Justin stops Kate from springing a trap she missed]

JUSTIN: Watch it. [Kate sees the tripwire]

KATE: Thank you.

JIN: Looks like one of Rousseaus traps.

JUSTIN: The french woman? She's been dead for years, this couldn't be one of--

ALDO: Justin! Shut up.

[Kate walks up to Aldo and pokes him in the chest with her canteen]

KATE: What was he gonna say?

ALDO: You don't even remember me do you? [Kate looks confused] - You don't recognize me? Well maybe this'll jog your memory - three years ago, you staged yourself a little prison break, [Kate innocently takes a swig of water] and ya did it by knocking the guard out with the butt of your rifle, that would be me- [Kate knocks Aldo out with the canteen then she turns quickly and throws it at the tripwire, activating the trap which sends a net full of rocks smashing into Justin, knocking him out]

[Kate picks up Aldo's gun and checks the cartridge]

JIN: What are you doing?

[Kate also picks up Justin's rifle, then walks up to Jin]

KATE: Escaping.

[Others bring Sayid back to the spring]

HURLEY: Sayid!

[Miles and Hurley hurry toward Sayid]

MILES: You ok man?

HURLEY: [grabbing Sayid] Jack! Sayid's back! [he props Sayid against a pillar]

JACK: Sayid. What happened?

SAYID: They tortured me.

JACK: Why?

SAYID: Don't know. They didn't ask me any questions.

[Jack, pissed off, walks up to the entrance to Dogens quarters and speaks to the guards]

JACK: Step aside.

[they do, to Jacks mild surprise - he walks through]

[Dogen is mixing an unknown substance together - Lennon is near a bookshelf reading a book]

LENNON: Hey Shephard. [snaps book shut] - We were hoping you'd come on your own.

JACK: [pointing back to spring] What the hell did you do to Sayid?

LENNON: We didn't do anything to him. You're friend is sick.

JACK: Sick with what?

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese] [he begins pouring unknown substance into a capsule]Kare wa kegasarete shimatta.(彼は汚されてしまった―He has been contaminated.)

LENNON: He's, yeah-I-tss, not really, there's not really a literal translation, the closest thing would be... infected.

JACK: Infected? He's not even runnin a fever.

[Dogen laughs, once.]

JACK: Did I say something funny?

LENNON: Eh, doubt it - he doesn't really have a sense of humor.

[Dogen places capsule into paper he was using to pour substance into capsule, folding it]

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese] Kore wo Jarrah ni nomasetemoraou(これをジャラーに飲ませてもらおう―I direct you should take it to him.)　

LENNON: He says, you have to give your friend this pill.

[Jack laughs sardonically]

JACK: Are you serious? [Dogen indicates Jack should take the pill] - Why don't you give it to him?

LENNON: Because it won't work unless he takes it willingly and he won't take it willingly from us.

JACK: Well, then maybe you should'a asked him to take it before ya tortured him.

LENNON: We didn't torture him. We were diagnosing him.

JACK: To see if he was infected.

LENNON: Yes.

JACK: I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid unless I know what's in it.

[Jack turns to walk away - Lennon looks at Dogen who indicates not to worry]

DOGEN: Tell me Shephard, your friend, how did he get shot?

JACK: He was, um... he was helping me.

DOGEN: So, it was your fault.

JACK: Yes.

DOGEN: And there have been others who were hurt, or died, helping you?

JACK: Yes.

DOGEN: Well, then this [shows Jack the pill] is your chance to redeem yourself.

[Dogen takes Jack's hand and places pill in it]

DOGEN: It's medicine. And your friend needs it.

JACK: What happens if I don't give it to him?

DOGEN: ...the infection will spread.

[Miles and Hurley are talking to Sayid by the spring]

MILES: So nothing? there wasn't anything? No white light? Angels singing? No dead relatives?

SAYID: I remember being shot.

HURLEY: You're not a zombie, right?

SAYID: No. I am not a zombie.

MILES: [noticing Jack] ...hey.

JACK: [to Miles and Hurley] ...mind giving me and Sayid a minute?

HURLEY: Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out coz they usually lead to me having to do something I don't quite understand.

JACK: Hah, I'm right there with ya.

MILES: It's fine... we'll be in the food court if you need us.

[Hurley and Miles leave - Jack drinks from canteen and offers it to Sayid, who declines]

SAYID: So did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?

JACK: He said they were trying to diagnose you.

SAYID: Right. They told me it was some sort of test. Which they said I passed. Clearly I didn't.

[Jack unfold paper with pill inside]

SAYID: What's that?

JACK: They want you to take it. It's medicine according to them.

SAYID: What about according to you?

JACK: I don't know. And you know before, when you, when you thanked me for saving your life... I didn't have anything to do with it Sayid. I didn't fix you, they did.

SAYID: I don't care who fixed me. I only care about who I trust. So if you want me to take that pill Jack, I'll do it.

[Jack looks at pill then at Sayid...]

JIN: Wait. Where are you going?

KATE: To catch up with Sawyer.

JIN: So you never planned to bring him back to the temple?

KATE: No. I'm not interested in being a prisoner, are you?

JIN: Where did your plane land Kate?

KATE: What?

JIN: The Ajira plane that you, Jack, and Hurley came in on. Where did it land?

KATE: I don't know.

JIN: Sun was on that plane too, and I have to find her.

KATE: You think they're gonna tell you? You think they care about you or about Sun or about any of us?

JIN: Who do you care about Kate?

KATE: Good luck Jin. [She walks away]

JIN: Once you catch up with Sawyer, then what?

KATE: I guess we'll figure that out together.

[Kate driving Claire to Brentwood in the cab]

CLAIRE: So, what happened to your handcuffs?

KATE: I cut them off.

CLAIRE: It's a beautiful neighborhood - bet they're a really nice couple... what?

KATE: I didn't say anything.

CLAIRE: What you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?

KATE: [facetiously] Why would I think that?

CLAIRE: Good. Coz They didn't.

KATE: This is it. [Kate stops cab outside a house]

CLAIRE: Um... will you come in with me?

KATE: Are you kidding me?

CLAIRE: Please I, I just, I really don't wanna go up there on my own.

[a woman opens the front door with Kate and Claire outside]

CLAIRE: Hi, um, Mrs. (Baskim ?) - I'm Claire Littleton.

BLONDE-LADY: Oh my god - ohh - I'm so sorry. Um, my husband... he left me. And, believe me, I wanted a baby so much, but I can't do it alone. I'm sorry. Look, I know I should've called you.

CLAIRE: ...So, uh, you, you just changed your mind!?

BLONDE-LADY: Look, my, my life is just a little bit complicated right--

KATE: She came all the way from Australia and you don't call?

CLAIRE: Oh my god! [her breathing becomes labored]

KATE: Are you ok?

CLAIRE: Ahhrgh! It's coming!

[Kate approaches the Dharma Barracks - she follows sounds from one of the houses - inside a bedroom she see's Sawyer pushing furniture to get at floorboards underneath - she remains silent and observes, puzzled]

[Sawyer removes Shoebox from the floor, takes out something and starts crying - Kate turns to leave, Sawyer hears her and draws his gun]

SAWYER: Who's there? ... Better come out now or so help me I'm just gonna start shootin'.

[he steps out the room and see's the back of Kate]

SAWYER: What the hell are you doin' here?

KATE: [without turning] I was worried about you. [She turns to face him]

[Sawyer walks right past her and out the house]

[Cab pull up rapidly to curb of hospital - a nurse (LVN? CNA?) comes out with a weelchair]

NURSE: What's happening?

CLAIRE: I, I think I'm having contractions.

NURSE: When did the start?

CLAIRE: Um, about three minutes ago.

NURSE: Try to relax, we're gonna take you to the (MCU?) to get looked at. [to Kate] Are you with her?

[Kate notices police cruiser behind her]

KATE: Yeah.

CLAIRE: What are you doing, what's going on!?

MARGRET: Hold on the doctor will be with you in just a moment.

CLAIRE: What's going on?

[Kate walks out OB Triage where Claire is and approaches a doctor]

KATE: Excuse me, excuse me.

[Ethan turns around to face Kate]

ETHAN: Yes?

KATE: Are you a doctor?

ETHAN: Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.

KATE: Can I please get your help in here?

[they enter room]

ETHAN: Miss Littleton, Claire how you feeling?

CLAIRE: Uncomfortable, wh-wha-what's happening?

ETHAN: What's happening... is that mother nature's gotten a little ahead of herself. Are you ready to have your baby?

CLAIRE: Ah-ah-I'm sorry what!?

ETHAN: You're at 36 weeks, 3 centimeters dilated, and about 80 percent effaced, which means - if you want you can have your baby tonight.

CLAIRE: If I want? So what y-yo-you mean you can stop it then?

ETHAN: Maybe, however to do that would require a number of drugs.

CLAIRE: wah-what drugs, I mean will that hurt the baby?

ETHAN: No they're perfectly safe, I just don't wanna have to stick you with needles if I don't have to. So, it's up to you.

CLAIRE: ...I-I'm not ready.

ETHAN: OK, lets get her started on an (iphedapine ?) drip.

[baby heart monitor next to Claire goes flat and emits continuous monotone beep]

CLAIRE: Wh-what is it?

ETHAN: Margret, let's do an ultrasound. [She goes to get machine] - I want to get a picture of what's going on in there - ah, it could just mean the baby's out of position.

CLAIRE: Wh-what are you saying - what's happening to my baby!? [in tears] is my baby ok? Is Aaron OK?

ETHAN: See? [ultrasound shows movement] There he is - everything's just fine. Your boy just likes to move around - hehe - 140 BPM - perfectly normal. I have a feeling, that Aaron, is gonna be a handful. Now let's see if we can slow this down. [Claire nods] - Ya did great mommy. Thanks.

[Claire smiles at Ethan and then at Kate, clutching her hand]

[Sawyer is sitting on the jetty for the submarine, Kate walks up to him]

KATE: Couple days ago, you asked me why I came back to the island... I need to find Claire. I thought, maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me - and then, maybe if we could find her and bring her back to Aaron then maybe all of this wouldn't have been for nothing.

SAWYER: huh

KATE: I'm sorry. I never should've followed you.

SAWYER: Which time?

KATE: That was your house right? With Juliet?

SAWYER: ...yep.

KATE: I'm sorry.

SAWYER: You already said that.

KATE: No... for Juliet. If I hadn't come after you on the sub then you two would'a left and she would have never died.

SAWYER: It's not your fault she's dead... It's mine. She was sittin' right there, right where you are now, tryin' to leave this place - and I convinced her to stay. I made her stay on this island because I didn't want to be alone. You understand that right? ... But, uh... But I think some of us are meant to be alone. [Sawyer glances down at ring he's holding] I was gonna ask her to marry me.

[Sawyer stands up and tosses ring into water]

SAWYER: You can probably make it back to the temple by nightfall. [he walks away]

[Kate starts crying]

[Dogen, at his desk, is spinning a baseball - Jack walks up to him]

JACK: What's that?

DOGEN: It's a baseball.

[Jack grins and sits down facing Dogen]

JACK: You speak pretty good English for someone that needs a translator.

DOGEN: We both know that I don't need a translator.

JACK: Then why do you have one?

DOGEN: Because, I have to remain separate from the people I'm in charge of. It makes it easier when they don't like the decisions I make for them.

JACK: Who are you?

DOGEN: My name is Dogen.

JACK: Are you from here? The island?

DOGEN: I was brought here like everyone else.

JACK: What do you mean, brought here?

DOGEN: You know exactly what I mean.

[Jack gets up and turns away]

DOGEN: You didn't give your friend the pill. Did you?

JACK: No.

DOGEN: Why not?

JACK: Because I don't know what's in it.

DOGEN: It will eliminate the in--

JACK: The infection, yeah, I got that. But what's in it?

DOGEN: I can not explain.

JACK: Try.

DOGEN: There isn't any time. He'll die if you--

JACK: He already died! ... What is in it? [holds up pill]

DOGEN: You just have to trust me.

JACK: [smiling] ... I don't trust myself. How am I supposed to trust you?

[Jack steps away from Dogen]

JACK: Let's see where trust gets us. [Jack swallows pill]

[Dogen immediately hits Jack in the stomach, the back, and performs the Heimlich maneuver till the pill falls out - he picks it up]

JACK: [labored breathing] ...now, are you gonna tell me - what's in it!?

DOGEN: Poison.

[Claire is looking at her sonogram in the hospital; A detective and a cop come into the room]

CLAIRE: Come in.

DETECTIVE: Excuse me, Ms. Littleton?

CLAIRE: Yeah?

DETECTIVE: I'm detective Rasmussen. Is Ms. Hart here?

CLAIRE: I'm sorry, who?

DETECTIVE: Joan Hart. She signed in with you.

CLAIRE: Oh, she was just um, the cab driver. I needed help and she brought me up here. She left after they treated me.

DETECTIVE: Did she give you any indication where she was headed?

CLAIRE: Why, is something wrong?

DETECTIVE: Nope. It's nothing for you to worry about. [to cop] Come on, let's go. [they leave the room]

KATE: Thanks.

CLAIRE: Sure. Thank you. Why-why are they after you? What did you do?

KATE: Would you believe me if I said I was innocent?

CLAIRE: Yeah. Yeah I would.

KATE: I should go.

CLAIRE: Oh wait. Here, take my credit card.

KATE: No-

CLAIRE: There's not much a limit on it, but it's something.

KATE: You don't have to do this.

CLAIRE: You didn't have to do what you did either.

KATE: Aaron's a great name.

CLAIRE: I don't know why I said it; it's like, I don't know, I knew it or something.

KATE: I think you should keep him.

CLAIRE: Well, um, good luck.

KATE: Yeah, you too.

CLAIRE: Thanks.

[Kate is filling her canteen with water. Sawyer walks out of the house, walks past her, and goes into another house.]

[Kate turns to leave New Otherton]

LENNON: He swallowed it?

DOGEN: Yes.

JACK: What's this?

DOGEN: Tea.

JACK: Why would you people want to kill Sayid?

DOGEN: We believe he has been 'mesareteittandarou' (召されていったんだろう).

LENNON: Closest translation is.. Claimed.

JACK: Claimed? By what?

DOGEN: There is a darkness growing in him. And once it reaches his heart, everything your friend once was will be gone.

JACK: I- How can you be sure of that?

DOGEN: Because it happened to your sister.

ALDO: Now, where's that bitch?

JIN: I don't know. You don't understand. I'm going back to the Temple.

ALDO: Yeah right.
