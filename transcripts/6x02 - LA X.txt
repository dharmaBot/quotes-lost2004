HURLEY: It's not a guitar man.

MILES: Then what is it?

KATE: [to Saywer] ...you going with them?

SAWYER: No, I'm gonna bury her.

KATE: Let me help you.

SAWYER: Help Sayid. Hey Miles, you mind hangin' back?

OCEANIC-MALE: Oh, Mr. Shephard, hello, yes - that was me, uh, sorry I meant to meet you at the gate.

JACK: Well, I'm here now. So...

OCEANIC-MALE: Mr. Shephard, I'm deeply sorry but there seems to have been a mix up involving the, uh, cargo you checked in Sydney.

JACK: Cargo?

OCEANIC-MALE: Yes sir, a coffin?

JACK: I don't...[sigh]...I don't understand, I mean are you saying that it's not here?

OCEANIC-MALE: It appears it was never put on the plane.

JACK: [visibly upset] The funeral is in two hours - when is it getting here?

OCEANIC-MALE: Mr. Shephard, I can't tell you how deeply sorry we are but we don't know when it will arrive, because we're not exactly sure where it is.

[Jack, Jin, Sayid, Kate, Hurely - approach wall surrounding temple]

HURLEY: That's a big wall.

JACK: How're we gonna get him over the top?

[Hurley walks up to hole in wall, looking down]

HURLEY: We're not, we're bringing him in through here.

[they all go down, Kate finds bag, Hurley sees a book]

HURLEY: Who brings a book into a cave?

[Kate finds matches and lights torch, which is next to skeleton with missing arm]

HURLEY: And why is his arm missing?

[Kate lights torch]

JIN: It was ripped off when he was attacked by the black smoke.

HURLEY: Well, this is gonna be awesome.

[all walk up to hole where Ben fell down]

JACK: Watch your step.

KATE: Yeah.

[kate walks around hole]

KATE: OK.

EDWARD MARS: No, open this door right now.

KATE: I'm not finished.

EDWARD MARS: Yes you are, open it... Austen, I swear to god you don't open this door I'm commin in there.

[Kate kicks door, disables Mars, takes his gun and searches for keys to cuffs (presumably)] [two women walk in on scene...]

RANDOM-LADY: Oh my god!

KATE: He, he just walked in here and attacked me - I pushed him - I just, I need to get outta here.

RANDOM-LADY: Officer! Come quick, come quick.

[Kate runs to elevator]

KATE: Wait, hold the door.

SAWYER: What'd she wanna tell me Miles?

MILES: Excuse me?

SAWYER: Juliet. She said she wanted to tell me something, then she died. What was it Miles?

MILES: That's why you asked me to stay here with you?

SAWYER: You're the only one around that talks to dead people.

MILES: Jim, that's not how it works.

SAWYER: What did she wanna tell me Miles?

MILES: Hey...it doesn't matter.

SAWYER: It does matter.

MILES: It's not gonna help.

SAWYER: Just do it! Just ask her.

MILES: She's gone James!

[Sawyer throws Miles on top of grave]

SAWYER: I know she's gone. I know. Now tell me.

MILES: OK. ok, ok, alright, alright.

[Miles does his ghostbuster thing - vague sounds reminiscent of plane turbulence]

MILES: It worked.

SAWYER: What did she wanna tell me?

MILES: That's what she wanted to tell you. It worked.

SAWYER: What worked?

[jack et al are lead to a temple entrance]

RANDOM-OTHER: Stop right here.

[Jin and Sun are going through customs]

CUSTOMS-AGENT: And what business are you in sir?

JIN: No English. [Takes out letter with Paik logo on top]

CUSTOMS-AGENT: This letter says the watch is a business gift, can you tell me what business you're in? [Jin points to letter] [Frustrated, agent continues search]

[Jin speaks Korean - sub: Everything should be in order. May we please continue on our way?]

[Jin speaks Korean - sub: I don't have time for this...]

CUSTOMS-AGENT: Take her to the waiting area.

FEMALE-CUSTOMS-AGENT: Ms. Paik, do you understand any English?

SUN: No...English.

[Dogen, others, and Losties walk to spring]

LENNON: The water isn't clear - what happened?

DOGEN: [Japanese]nani ga okottanoka wakaran(何が起こったのか分からん-I don't know what happened) [he goes to spring, cuts his palm with a knife]

KATE: What is he doing?

JACK: I don't know.

[Dogen dips his bleeding hand into spring, bringing it out still bleeding]

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese while pointing at Sayid]kore ha dareni yarareta noda(これは誰にやられたのだ？-Who was this done by?)

LENNON: [pointing at Sayid] Who did this to him?

JACK: My fault, I didn't shoot him but it's my fault.

DOGEN: [Japanese]dekiru kagiri no koto wa suruga, soreniha kiken ga tomonau(出来る限りのことはするが、それには危険が伴う-I'll try as much as I can, but it'll come with risks.)

LENNON: If we do this there are risks ... you understand?

JACK: Do what you have to do.

DOGEN: [Japanese]kono otoko wo izumi no nakae(この男を泉の中へ-Put this man into the spring.)

LENNON: [addressing others] Take off the coveralls, put him in.

[they comply, as Sayid's body is placed head first into spring, Dogen turns over a conspicuous hour glass]

JACK: What are they doing?

[Lennon ignores him]

HURLEY: Can unconscious people hold their breath?

JACK: No.

[Sayid begins to convulse, the others firmly hold him under water]

JACK: He's awake, let him up.

[Dogen ignores him]

JIN: What are they waiting for?

KATE: That's enough!

[Dogen continues to observe hourglass]

JACK: [approaching Dogen] I said, let him up!

[Dogen uses martial arts (Karate?) to rapidly disable Jack, and continues to watch Sayid struggle]

HURLEY: You're not saving him! You're drowning him!

[Sayid stops struggling just before the last grains of sand fall from the top of the hourglass]

[The others bring Sayid out of the spring when prompted by Dogen, who checks Sayid]

DOGEN: [Japanese]kare wa shinda(彼は死んだ-He died.)

LENNON: You're friend is dead.

[Jack goes to inspect Sayid's pulse, then starts chest compressions]

KATE: Jack... Jack, stop, what are you doing?

[Jack stops]

yid is waiting for baggage at LAX, looking at a photo of Nadia]

[Kate is walking around with a coat hiding her handcuffs, she notices a lady using a code (75...1) on a security door for airport personnel]

[Kate sees TSA officials pointing in her direction, she goes through the security door and up an escalator and walks to a yellow-cab]

FROGURT: Woah, woah, woah, I don't think so lady, there's a line. There's a line!

KATE: Sorry. [she gets in line behind Hurley]

HURLEY: [on cell phone] [indistinct chatter] ... Outback is just a name, you sayin' they own the entire outback? That's just stupid.

[Kate notices Mars is outside too, talking frantically to cops]

EDWARD MARS: [indistinct] ...she's gonna be coming outta customs I want you guys to take the other door.

EDWARD MARS: Hey!

[Kate gets into a cab]

KATE: Go... go now!

CAB-DRIVER: Lady, I already have a customer.

[Kate, Jack, Jin, and Hurley are sitting around spring, looking at Sayid's body - Cindy walks in, followed by Zack and Emma]

CINDY: Thought you might like a little something to eat or drink. Zack, Emma, then take the rest to the people over there.

RANDOM-OTHER: Just drop 'em in here.

[Some others drag an unconscious Sawyer and harassed Miles into room]

KATE: Hey, what happened?

MILES: They jumped us in the jungle - he took four of them out, before one of them hit him with a damn rock.

[Kate tends to Sawyer, Jack looks away - Lennon walks up to Hurley]

LENNON: You, come with me.

HURLEY: Come with you where?

[They walk up to Dogen tending plants in another room - without looking around he addresses them]

DOGEN: [speaks Japanese]kare ni kiitekure, Jacob wa seikaku ni nanto itta noka(彼に訊いてくれ、ジェイコブは正確に何と言ったのか-Ask him what exactly Jacob said, what instructions he got.)

LENNON: He wants to know what Jacob told you.

HURLEY: He told me to come here. Said you guys would save Sayid.

DOGEN: [Japanese]kare wa sudeni teokure datta(彼は既に手遅れだった-It was too late for him.)

LENNON: He was beyond saving.

HURLEY: Wait a second - you're not translating anything I say to him - which means you totally understand me dude.

DOGEN: [in English, to Hurley] I don't like the way English tastes on my tongue.

DOGEN: [Japanese]de, Jacob wa itsu kurunda(で、ジェイコブはいつ来るんだ-So, when is Jacob coming?)

LENNON: When's Jacob getting here?

HURLEY: What do you mean?

LENNON: Is he coming to the temple?

HURLEY: I really don't think that's gonna happen man.

LENNON: Why not?

HURLEY: You know - cuz he's dead.

[Dogen faces Hurley, consternated]

HURLEY: What - you guys didn't know?

[cut scene to Jack - he hears bells start ringing and much activity/chatter amongst others]

DOGEN: [yells in Japanese to the others] (Everybody, to posts!)

LENNON: Everyone to your posts! On the walls, prepare the ash!

[an other loads a large flare, another other starts pouring ash around the temple]

DOGEN: [Japanese]higashi no kabe ni shubi wo katamero! (東の壁に守備を固めろ!-Defense to the east wall!)

DOGEN: [Japanese]juu nin ha kita ni maware(10人は北に回れ!-Ten men to north side!)

LENNON: Ten men on the north side!

DOGEN: [Japanese]juubun chui shiro!(十分注意しろ!-Very careful!)

LENNON: Send the warning!

DOGEN: [Japanese]mina ni konokoto wo tsutaerunda, yoshi tenka! (皆にこのことを伝えるんだ、よし点火!-??? Okay, light it!)

LENNON: Light it!

[flare is lit - red sparks explode overhead]

HURLEY: Guess we're not getting outta here huh?

LENNON: This isn't to keep you in, it's to keep him out.

HURLEY: Him? Who?

[Locke, in the 4-toed foot, drags bodies of others into pile - Ben sits by the fire staring at him]

BEN: What are you?

LOCKE: Wh.. I'm not a what Ben, I'm a who.

BEN: You're the monster.

LOCKE: Let's not resort to name calling.

[Locke snaps protruding bloody rock from Brams chest, and drags his body into pile]

BEN: You used me... you couldn't kill him yourself, so you made me do it.

LOCKE: I didn't make you do anything. You should know, he was very confused when you killed him.

BEN: I seriously doubt that Jacob was ever confused.

LOCKE: I'm not talking about Jacob. I'm talking about John Locke. Do you wanna know what he was thinking while you, choked the life outta him Benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand". Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way, because when John first came to the island, he was a very sad man. A victim, shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak, and pathetic, and irreparably broken. But, despite all that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them that didn't wanna leave. The only one, who realized how pitiful the life he'd left behind actually was.

BEN: What do you want?

LOCKE: Well that's the great irony here Ben because, I want the one thing that John Locke didn't. I want to go home.

[Locke shows his mean face]

[Hurley leans in to whisper into Sayid's ear]

HURLEY: Goodbye dude, If you ever wanna talk, I'm around.

[Hurley looks at a confused looking Miles sitting next to Sayid]

HURLEY: What?

MILES: Nothing.

[Kate is tending to Sawyer on other side of spring]

KATE: Hey.

SAWYER: Where are we?

KATE: We're in a temple.

SAWYER: We got caught by the others again?

KATE: Yeah, only, this time they're protecting us, I think.

SAWYER: Course they are.

[Sawyer sits up]

KATE: You alright?

SAWYER: ah...[touches his forhead]

KATE: I'm so sorry.

[Sawyer stares at Jack]

KATE: You know what you said back at the hatch, he's just tryin'a help us.

SAWYER: I ain't gonna kill Jack, he deserves to suffer on this rock just like the rest of us.

[Jack is talking on cell phone in Oceanic Lost and Found section]

JACK: Yeah... I know...I ... do you think I knew this was gonna happen? I scheduled it so soon because I wanna get it over with. I don't know mom, he's not here so I can't tell you what to tell them other than we can't have the service without him. Yeah - I will call you if I hear anything. [Jack hangs up]

LOCKE: [unseen until now] What did you lose?

JACK: Excuse me?

LOCKE: Well, they lost one of my bags, what about you?

JACK: You wouldn't believe me if I told ya.

LOCKE: Hah, try me.

JACK: They lost my father.

LOCKE: I'm sorry?

JACK: He died in Australia a couple days ago, and um, I flew down to get him.

LOCKE: My condolences.

[Locke completes form he was filling out, and addresses Oceanic staff]

LOCKE: Yo.

JACK: Coffin was supposed to go on the plane in Sydney, but it didn't. Apparently he's somewhere in transit which is their way of saying, they have no idea where the hell he is.

LOCKE: Well, how could they know.

JACK: They're the one's that checked him in, I mean they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.

LOCKE: No I'm not talking about the coffin, I mean how could they know where he is. They didn't lose your father, they just lost his body.

[Jack, seeming to understand Locke, nods - Lock smiles]

LOCKE: Either way, your story beats the hell outta mine - all that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives. [Oceanic staff gives Locke a receipt] Thanks.

JACK: Some kinda salesman?

LOCKE: Yeah, something like that. Well it was nice talking to ya, hope ya find that coffin.

JACK: Hope you find your knives.

LOCKE: Yeah thanks. [Locke begins to wheel himself out]

JACK: Mind if I ask what happened to ya? [Locke is silent] I'm sorry, I'm only asking because I'm a spinal surgeon, I didn't mean to...

LOCKE: Oh, no, don't worry about it - uh, uh surgery isn't gonna do anything to help me, my condition is irreversible.

JACK: Nothing is irreversible. Umm, if you ever wanna consult, just uh, gimme a call. [Jack hands Locke his business card] - It's on the house.

LOCKE: Well thanks [takes card - reads name] - Jack Shephard, I'm John - John Locke.

JACK: It's nice to meet ya John.

LOCKE: Nice to meet you too.

[Jack opens door for Locke]

LOCKE: Thanks.

JACK: You're welcome.

re fired from temple is visible in sky - Richard sitting on the beach notices it]

LAPIDUS: What the hell is that?

[Richard looks scared]

[Rifles are cocked and pointed at Locke as people see him and Ben walking toward them]

RICHARD: Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!

LAPIDUS: I'm seein' it - But I'm still not believin' it.

[Locke walks up to Richard]

LOCKE: Hello Richard. It's good to see you outta those chains.

RICHARD: [eyes widen] ... you?

LOCKE: Me.

[Locke immediately hits Richard in the throat, then knocks him unconscious]

LOCKE: I am very disappointed ... in all of you.

[Locke puts Richard on his shoulder, and walks right past the corpse of Locke in the Ajira cargo box]

[Lennon and a couple others walk up to Jack, still looking at Sayid's corpse]

LENNON: You Shephard?

JACK: Yeah.

LENNON: We need to speak to you privately.

JACK: If you've got something to say to me then say it, otherwise just leave me alone.

LENNON: I don't think you're understanding me here, I'm asking politely, you either get up and come with us on your own, or I'll have ya dragged out. Because we are going to have this conversation and it's not going to be here.

[Jack gets up and confrontation-ally approaches Lennon]

JACK: Is that right.

[Jack and others start to wrestle - Hurley and Lennon are both distracted by something else]

HURLEY: Jack!

[all turn around to see Sayid slowly stirring to life]

LENNON: Oh my god.

JACK: Wha...

SAYID: What happened?
