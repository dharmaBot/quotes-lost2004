JULIET: Jack! Jack! Jack? Jack, I need you to wake up. Jack! Can you hear me? You okay?

BERNARD: Come on! Come on! I just wanna know why.

JACK: What happened?

JULIET: Here.

ROSE: He knows somethin'!

BERNARD: I want the truth!

FARADAY: I don't know. That's the truth. I'm telling you, I don't know why, but there's no signal now.

BERNARD: Signal? What, there was a signal when you called them last night.

ROSE: That's right.

BERNARD: So--so--so what? Now they're just ignoring us?

CHARLOTTE: How are we supposed to know why they're not answering?

ROSE: Oh, who's talking to you?

CHARLOTTE: And in case you haven't noticed, we're not on the bloody boat, are we?

ROSE: Just watch your tone, Red.

BERNARD: I just wanna know why.

JACK: Hey! Everybody just needs to calm down, okay?

BERNARD: Jack, these people are lying to us.

JACK: I know they're lying. I know it. Sooner or later, their people are gonna come back for them, and when they do, we'll be waiting for them.

ROSE: Unless they run off again.

JACK: Listen to me.

ROSE: Jack, are you all right?

JACK: No, I'm fine. We just have to be patient, okay? I've gotten us this far. I said I was gonna get us off the Island--all of us. I promised that I would.

[Woman gasps]

[Jack? Jack?]

BERNARD: Jack?

[Jack.]

ROSE: Is he all right?

[Breathing erratically]

[Jack?]

[Jack.]

[Birds chirping in distance]

[telephone rings]

[ring]

[ring]

[ring]

[sighs]

[beep]

JACK: Hello?

JANE: Dr. Shephard? Just confirming your 11:00 consult with Ms. Berenberg. It was moved up yesterday, and I know how you are with your calendar.

JACK: Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Jane. I'll, um... I'll be in there.

JANE: Thank you, doctor.

JACK: All right. Bye.

[Beep]

[sighs]

[dog barking in distance]

[clatter]

[whispers]

JACK: Ow. Son of a bitch.

[Slams lid]

[beep]

JACK: (Scoffs) A-Rod.

[Shower running]

JACK: Morning.

KATE: Morning yourself. I bought you a razor.

JACK: What, you don't like the scruff?

KATE: (Laughs) Razor's by the sink, Jack.

[Shower shuts off]

JACK: Morning.

[They kiss] 

JACK: "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: `Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Aha, that's the great puzzle."

[Door creaking]

KATE: You're a natural.

JACK: (Chuckles) Yeah?

KATE: Yeah.

JACK: My old man used to read me that story.

KATE: Really?

JACK: What?

KATE: It's just... it's just sweet hearing you say nice things about your dad.

JACK: (Chuckles) I don't say nice things about my dad? Well, he was a good storyteller. I'll give him that. Hey. You okay?

KATE: Yeah. Just, I... I love seeing you with him. I'm so glad you changed your mind. (Whispers) I'm so glad that you're here.

JACK: (Whispers) Me, too.

[Giggles]

JULIET: Keep him in the shade. I'll get him some water. Give--give him some air, guys.

JACK: (Grunts)

JULIET: You okay?

JACK: Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good.

KATE: Hey, what happened?

JULIET: He passed out.

KATE: You fainted?

JACK: I'm fine. I'm just, uh... just a little dehydrated.

KATE: No, Jack. You're not okay. You're burning up.

JACK: I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... just need to get a little rest.

JULIET: Jack--

JACK: I'm fine.

[Exhales deeply]

CLAIRE: Oh!

SAWYER: You okay?

CLAIRE: Yeah, just a bit woozy.

SAWYER: How's your head?

CLAIRE: It's better. Bit of a headache, but at least I'm not seeing things anymore.

MILES: Yeah? What'd you see?

SAWYER: Back off, Donger.

[Aaron cries.]

MILES: I'm just making conversation.

SAWYER: Let's make some time. I wanna cover more ground before we gotta camp tonight. If we hoof it, we can make it to the beach by noon tomorrow.

[Voices echo indistinctly, bullets whizz]

[Alex's voice "no!"]

[Gunshots, voices continue echoing indistinctly]

SAWYER: what?

[Aaron fusses.]

SAWYER: Hey. Hey!

MILES: Who's Danielle and Karl?

CLAIRE: Y--you mean Rousseau? The French woman?

[Aaron cries.]

CLAIRE: (Gasps) Oh, my God.

[Insect buzzing]

MILES: Is this your French woman?

SAWYER: Karl.

[Fusses]

SAWYER: How'd you know they were down there? Your buddies do this?

MILES: They're not my buddies, man. I didn't sign up for this.

CLAIRE: Can we just--can we just get out of here, please? Can we just go?

SAWYER: (Whispers) Yeah, yeah, of course. But don't worry. Once we get back to the beach, everything's gonna be fine. All right? Come on. Let's go.

[Aaron cries]

JACK: Ahh. (Groans) I hate being sick.

JULIET: What do you think it is?

JACK: It's food poisoning.

JULIET: What makes you think that?

JACK: I've got some cramping, dehydrated, nausea.

JULIET: I respectfully disagree.

JACK: (Chuckles) Do you?

JULIET: You want to lift your shirt up?

[Jack demurs.]

JULIET: If it's food poisoning, you got nothing to worry about.

[Jack inhales sharply.]

JULIET: It's your appendix, Jack. When did the pain start?

JACK: Yesterday.

JULIET: Has it ruptured?

JACK: Not yet.

JULIET: Well... I guess we're just gonna have to take it out. 

JULIET: Do you remember where the medical station is or don't you?

SUN: Yes, I remember.

JULIET: These are the instruments that I need you to bring back. You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room.

SUN: "Clamps"? "Sutures"? Juliet, I don't know what these look like.

FARADAY: I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments. Uh...

JULIET: I thought you were a physicist.

FARADAY: Yeah, well, I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if--if--

ROSE: No. We can't trust them.

CHARLOTTE: (Scoffs) See, Dan? I told you. They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em. Might as well keep playing the part.

FARADAY: Damn it, Charlotte. That right there, that right there. Your--your attitude--your very bad attitude--it's exactly why they don't trust us. (Whispers) Come on. (Normal voice) Juliet, please. Don't blame us for--for this, for whatever is happening. We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt. We just wanna help. Please let us help.

JULIET: (To Jin, as she hands him a gun) Either of them tries to run? Shoot 'em in the leg. Get back here as fast as you can.

FARADAY: Okay. Thank you.

[Click]

JULIET: We need to create a sterile environment. Find a hard surface, wash it down, gather as many tarps as you can.

KATE: Hey, Juliet. If everything that we need is at the medical station, then why don't we just bring Jack there?

JULIET: Because if we move him, there's a good chance that his appendix will rupture. And if that happens, he's gonna die.

[Creek babbling]

[footsteps approach]

SAWYER: Don't even think about it.

MILES: What?

SAWYER: Don't look at her. Don't talk to her. Don't mess with her. You got a restraining order. 20 feet.

[Zips up backpack]

MILES: What are you, her big brother?

SAWYER: No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face unless you say, "Yeah. I getcha."

MILES: Yeah. I getcha.

[Grunts]

BERNARD: All right. Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay. An appendectomy is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.

ROSE: That's not what I was thinking about. I was thinking, "Why did he get sick?"

BERNARD: Why? It's just--it's just bad luck.

ROSE: The day before we're all supposed to be rescued, the person that we count on the most suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition, and you're chalking it up to bad luck?

BERNARD: Well, what are you saying, that--that Jack did something to offend the gods? People get sick, Rose.

ROSE: Not here. Here, they get better.

JACK: When was the last time you did this?

JULIET: An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?

[Both chuckle.]

JULIET: In my residency. I did a lot of 'em back then.

[Taps razor]

JACK: Then you know the incision needs to be two inches lower than where you're shaving.

JULIET: I'm just cleaning the area.

JACK: Thank you. I wanna talk you through it.

JULIET: What?

JACK: I don't want to be unconscious. We can use the lidocaine to numb the area. And then I can watch the procedure, help you out.

JULIET: And, uh, how are you gonna watch flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?

JACK: We can use a mirror. Kate can hold it.

JULIET: If someone's going to be in there, shouldn't it be someone with medical experience? Bernard's a dentist--

JACK: No, I want it to be Kate.

[Taps razor]

JULIET: Okay.

JACK: Don't worry, Ms. Berenberg. You're in good hands.

MRS. BERENBERG: Thank you.

JACK: I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 A.M.?

MRS. BERENBERG: Mm-hmm.

JACK: And remember, no solid food. Okay?

MRS. BERENBERG: Thank you, Doctor.

JACK: Have a good evening.

[Elevator bell dings]

ERIKA: Jack? Jack?

[Telephone rings]

ERIKA: Will you take a look at this X-ray? Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think.

JACK: The L4. Yeah. Yeah.

RECEPTIONIST: Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you. It's a Dr. Stillman from Santa Rosa Hospital, says it's about a friend of yours.

DR. STILLMAN: He's refusing to take his meds, and he's stopped sleeping.

JACK: What about his therapy sessions?

DR. STILLMAN: Therapy's... been rendered useless.

JACK: And why is that?

DR. STILLMAN: Because he doesn't think I exist.

[Keypad beeps, door unlocks]

JACK: Hey, Hurley.

HURLEY: Hey, Jack.

JACK: Why aren't you taking your meds?

HURLEY: 'Cause we're dead... all of us. All the Oceanic Six--we're all dead. We never got off that island.

JACK: Hurley... that is not true.

HURLEY: What'd you do today?

JACK: What did I do today? I, uh... [sighs] I woke up, took a shower. Uh, Kate and I fed the baby.

HURLEY: I thought you didn't want anything to do with Aaron.

JACK: I changed my mind after the trial.

HURLEY: Living with Kate... taking care of Aaron... it all seems so perfect... just like heaven.

JACK: Just because I'm happy doesn't mean that this isn't real, Hurley.

HURLEY: I was happy, too, Jack... for a while, anyway. Then I saw Charlie. He likes to sit with me on the bench out on the front lawn. It's pretty cool, actually.

JACK: Okay. (Sighs) So what did the two of you talk about?

HURLEY: Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by. He wanted me to give you a message.

JACK: A message?

[Drawer scrapes]

HURLEY: He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up. "You're not supposed to raise him, Jack." Does that make any sense?

JACK: No, that... doesn't make any sense.

HURLEY: Do you think he means Aaron?

JACK: Take your meds, Hurley. Just take 'em.

HURLEY: Hey, Jack? Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you, too. Soon. 

FARADAY: We're here. Hey. Uh... why don't you let me go first? Um, you know, make sure everything's safe.

CHARLOTTE: Okay. Be careful, Dan.

FARADAY: Absolutely.

JIN: 저 여자는 저 남자가 좋아하는 걸 알까? [Subtitle: Do you think she knows he likes her?]

SUN: 그럼, 여잔데… 당연히 알지. [Subtitle: She's a woman. She knows.]

[Charlotte looks back and faintly smiles at the two Koreans. Jin notices.]

SUN: 어서 가요. [Subtitle: Jin. Come on.]

[The secret door to the medical lab makes a grinding sound across the floor as it slides open. The four enter the lab.]

FARADAY: where do you suppose all this power's coming from?

CHARLOTTE: Add that one to the list, Dan. Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we?

[Daniel and Charlotte begin rummaging for supplies. Sun takes interest in the examining table.]

JIN: 괜찮아? [Subtitle: Are you all right?]


SUN: 줄리엣이 날 데리고 온 곳이에요. 여기서 우리 아기를 봤어요. [Subtitle: This is where Juliet brought me. This is where I saw our baby.]

[She indicates the ultrasound equipment, a bottle of ultrasound gel still sitting near the monitor. Charlotte hands Daniel something she scavenged.]

SUN: 진수씨, 저 사람들이 우리를 도와 줄 것 같지 않아요. [Subtitle: They're not going to help us, Jin.]

[Charlotte looks over at them. Jin notices.]

JIN: 자기야, 걱정 마. 내가 한 말 이해 가지? 당신하고 우리 아기는 이 섬에서 꼭 벗어나게 할 거야. [Subtitle: Don't worry about them. I promise you, Sun. I will get you and our baby off this island.]

[Birds chirp as Sawyer, followed by Claire and Miles, trek through the dense jungle. Stepping underneath a fallen tree, Claire stumbles and loses a shoe.]

MILES: Whoa! Hey, you want a hand with the baby?

CLAIRE: (Dismissively) Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

MILES: You sure? I'm good with kids.

[Sawyer turns back to threaten Miles.]

SAWYER: What part of "restraining order" don't you understand?

[They turn as they hear leaves rustling. Sawyer cocks his rifle.]

SAWYER: (Whispers) Get behind me, Claire.

[They hear footsteps approaching. Sawyer points his gun in the direction of the sound. Frank Lapidus emerges from the foliage carrying an aviation first aid kit and a beeping satellite phone.]

LAPIDUS: Whoa! Hey!

SAWYER: Who the hell are you?

MILES: Lapidus?

LAPIDUS: Miles?

SAWYER: You two know each other?

LAPIDUS: You gotta hide, man, right now.

MILES: What?

LAPIDUS: Keamy's coming back, and if he sees you, he'll kill all of ya.

[The pace of the sat-phone beeping picks up.]

LAPIDUS: And he's close, man. You gotta hide now! Go! Hide!

SAWYER: Come on.

[Sawyer grabs Claire's hand.]

LAPIDUS: Just hide!

SAWYER: Come on. Come on. Let's go!

[Miles follows them into a thicket, where they crouch down.]

[The sat-phone beeping increases rapidly--then stops when Keamy and five other members of the freighter's military team step out of the jungle. One of them, badly wounded, is braced on the shoulders of two other men.]

KEAMY: Where's the chopper?

LAPIDUS: It's about a click back that way.

KEAMY: Did you bring the kit?

LAPIDUS: Yeah, it's right here. Jeez, man, he looks bad. What the hell happened?

KEAMY: You do your job. I'll do mine.

[Keamy takes the first aid kit from Lapidus and hands it to the black mercenary. Birds chirp, and one high-pitched bird in particular. From hidden within the brush, Aaron cries softly. The high-pitched bird chirps again. Keamy looks around for the source of the noise.]

LAPIDUS: Okay. It's gettin' dark, man. We gotta leave now.

[Sawyer readies his gun to fire at Keamy should they be discovered.]

LAPIDUS: Mr. Keamy, we gotta get back to the chopper.

LAPIDUS: Keamy, we gotta get back, 'cause I'll tell ya right now, I am not flying Faraday's bearings at night. I'm not gonna do it. So if you wanna get back, we gotta leave right now, sir.

KEAMY: Fine. You lead the way.

[Keamy gives up his search for the noise.]

KEAMY: Come on.

MAN 1: Okay.

MAN 2: Come on.

MAN 3: Watch it now.

[The mercenaries leave with Lapidus. Sawyer and the others breathe a sigh of relief.]

[Back on the beach, Juliet and Kate approach each other.]

KATE: The tent's all set. Everything's ready.

JULIET: Good. Thanks. Listen, I could use an extra pair of hands in there. You wanna help me out?

KATE: Um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.

JULIET: It's just holding a mirror. Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it."

[Kate chuckles.]

JULIET: What?

KATE: I'm just surprised he's not taken it out of himself by now.

[Juliet smiles to herself. Jack emerges from the tent, stumbling.]

JULIET: Jack. What are you doin'?

JACK: I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet.

KATE: I'll help you.

[Jack exhales sharply as Kate goes to assist him.]

JULIET: They're gonna be back with the instruments soon. We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back. See you in there.

[Juliet leaves.]

KATE: So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.

JACK: (Sighs) Wouldn't be the first time.

[Kate chuckles.]

JACK: Listen, um... if something happens to me--

KATE: Shut up, Jack.

JACK: (Chuckles) Fair enough.

[A train horn blows in the distance. Jack, wearing a suit, sits in his Ford Bronco outside Santa Rosa Mental Health Facility at night. Jack stares at the table where Hurley said he met with Charlie. Jack starts the car and drives off.]

[Jack finds Kate asleep in bed.]

JACK: Kate? Kate?

[Kate stirs when Jack touches her.]

JACK: Wake up, Kate. Hey.

KATE: (Sniffles) Hey. What time is it?

JACK: It's late. I just got home.

KATE: Were you working?

JACK: No. I just... had to stop and get something. I just... took a while.

KATE: Hey. What's going on? What's wrong?

JACK: The other night, when I was reading to Aaron, you said... that I was a natural. (Sighs) Do you really... do you really think that I'm good at this?

KATE: Yeah. You're good at this.

JACK: (Sighs) Will you marry me? (Gasps)

[Jack removes a small box from his pocket and opens it. Kate gasps twice, and they both chuckle as he takes out the ring.]

KATE: Yes. (Laughs)

[Jack sniffles.]

KATE: Of course I will. Yes.

[They kiss, laugh, and hug.] 

[It's nighttime on the beach. Juliet lights a torch on the campfire and hands it to Bernard.]

BERNARD: Look, they're back.

[Juliet turns to Daniel and Charlotte.]

JULIET: Did you find everything?

FARADAY: Yes, ma'am. The entire list. Is he okay?

JULIET: For now. Sun, we need to sterilize these. There's a pot of water boiling over here.

[Juliet and Daniel move off.]

JIN: Charlotte.

CHARLOTTE: Yeah?

JIN: 난 알고 있어. [Subtitle: I know you understand me.]

CHARLOTTE: Pardon?

JIN: 너 한국말 할 줄 알지? 아까 우리가 너 이야기 할 때 너 웃는 거 내가 봤어. 그리고 너 스테이션에서도 우리 말 엿듣고 있었지? [Subtitle: I know you speak Korean. You smiled when Sun and I talked about you. And you were listening to us at the station.]

CHARLOTTE: I'm sorry. Perhaps I can get your wife to translate--

JIN: 계속 날 속이면… 니 친구 다니엘을 가만 두지 않겠어. 앞으로 그 친구 손가락 쓰기는 아마 힘들걸? 이해가 되지? [Subtitle: If you continue to lie... I'm going to hurt your friend Daniel. I'm going to break his fingers one at a time. Do you understand that?]

CHARLOTTE: 나한테 원하는 게 뭐죠? [Subtitle: What do you want?]

JIN: 헬리콥터가 돌아오면… 내 아내를 데리고 이 섬을 떠나기만 하면 돼. [Subtitle: When the helicopter comes for you... You're going to take my wife off this island.]

CHARLOTTE: 당신과 당신 친구는요? [Subtitle: What about you and the rest of your friends?]

JIN: 넌 선만 헬리콥터에 태우면 돼. [Subtitle: Just get her on the helicopter.]

[Charlotte nods. Jin leaves.]

[Juliet activates a makeshift surgery lamp by turning on four flashlights bound together and hung from the ceiling of a tent. Kate ties her hair back. Bernard flicks the bubbles out of a syringe of local anesthetic. He swabs an area on Jack's lower right abdomen.]

BERNARD: You know, Jack, they found some chloroform at the medical station. I could knock you out. Wouldn't you rather be dreaming about something nice back home?

JACK: No, I'll manage with the lidocaine.

JACK: Kate.

[Jack grunts as Bernard injects him with the anesthetic at several sites and he adjusts the mirror Kate holds for him.]

JACK: Just hold it right there.

BERNARD: Okay, now this is gonna numb the area of the first incision. After that, I would like to be able to tell you you' not gonna feel a thing, but... you will.

JULIET: You ready?

[Juliet snaps the latex gloves over her hands.]

JULIET: Okay. Here we go.

[Juliet begins the incision into Jack's flesh. Jack grunts. She continues. He grunts again, and again.]

JULIET: Okay, Jack. One more.

JACK: Oh!

JULIET: Okay, try not to move.

[Jack grunts.]

JULIET: Just stay still. (To Bernard) Spreader.

JACK: Kate, I--I can't see it.

KATE: Sorry.

JULIET: Don't worry about the mirror. Just stay still. (To Bernard) Spreader.

JACK: (Groaning) That's good. That's good. Yeah. This is it. That's good.

[Juliet inserts the spreader and clicks it open.]

JACK: Aah! (Grunting loudly)

JULIET: Knock him out, Bernard.

[Bernard moves to get the chloroform.]

JACK: No! No. Hey. Not wanna be unconscious.

JULIET: You don't want to be out of control.

JACK: Kate.

JULIET: Kate, you need to leave.

JACK: No.

JULIET: Bernard!

JACK: Kate,--

JULIET: Kate, you need to go.

JACK: --please.

JULIET: Bernard!

[Bernard's still busy getting the chloroform.]

JACK: No!

JULIET: Kate, get out of here! Bernard.

JACK: Kate...

KATE: Jack.

JULIET: Kate. Kate, get outta here! Damn it, Bernard! Knock him out!

BERNARD: I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.

[Jack grunts a final "No!" as Bernard holds the cloth over his mouth and nose. Everything goes]

[white, pure white. We're looking at a backlit X-ray examination board. Jack puts a new film into place showing a spine, and begins dictating into a recorder.]

JACK: Laker, Ryan. Patient is male, 36.

[Jack hears a distant beep.]

JACK: Osteoblastoma is present in the posterior area of the lumbar. I am recommending biopsy for...

[Another beep. And a third. Jack puts down his work, exits his office. Another beep. He closes the door and walks down the hallway. The beeping continues. He looks up at the source: a rogue smoke alarm placed over the reception desk of the Neurosurgery Group at St. Sebastian Hospital. Jack scrapes a chair across the floor, gets up on it, and up on the desk to reach the smoke alarm. He extracts the battery to end the beeping, putting the thing out of its misery, then gets down from the desk and examines the battery. He's startled to hear]

CHRISTIAN: Jack?

[Jack jumps and turns around. There, sitting on a couch in the waiting area, is his father, Christian Shepard, wearing the suit he was to be buried in and white sneakers. Jack slowly moves closer to his father, who sits up. A dark figure comes up behind Jack.]

ERIKA: Jack?

[Jack gasps and turns around. It's Dr. Erika Stevenson, a co-worker of Jack's in the Neurosurgery Group. She looks to the couch in the waiting area. Jack turns back, but no one sits there. He sighs deeply.]

ERIKA: You okay?

JACK: Uh, yeah. I'm--I'm... I'm okay. I, uh... I just, uh...

[Erika looks on, concerned. Jack holds his head, and holds back tears.]

JACK: The, um, the smoke detector was... was beeping, and I just...

ERIKA: Okay. Thank you for keeping us safe.

[She begins to leave.]

JACK: Erika, um... (sighs) Do you mind doing me a favor?

ERIKA: Yeah, sure.

JACK: Can you write a script for... clonazepam?

ERIKA: For you?

JACK: Yeah, um... I just got a lot going on right now, and I'm just a little snowed under with all my caseload, and Kate and I got engaged. Just... not sleepin' very well at night, you know? Just...

[Erika takes out her prescription pad and scribbles on it. She rips the paper off the pad and hands Jack his script.]

JACK: Thank you.

ERIKA: You know, getting engaged is supposed to help reduce stress, not create it.

JACK: Yeah. (Chuckles) You're right.

ERIKA: Maybe you should talk to someone.

JACK: I'll do that.

ERIKA: Good night.

JACK: Good night.

[At Kate's house, walks in and closes the front door. He hears Kate's voice. She's on the phone in the kitchen.]

KATE: Yeah, I'll just have the nanny stay for an extra couple hours. Jack's never home before 8:00 anyway. I could stay for at least an hour. (Keys jangle) I--I gotta go. Jack's home. Yeah, okay. I'll call you later. Bye.

[The phone beeps as Kate hangs up.]

JACK: Hey.

KATE: Hey. You scared me.

[Kate gets herself a glass of water from the filter pitcher in the refrigerator.]

JACK: Sorry. I thought you'd be in bed. Who was that?

KATE: That was Noreen.

JACK: Noreen?

KATE: Yeah. She's one of the moms from the park. What?

JACK: Nothing. I just... never heard you mention her before.

KATE: Well, now you have.

[She leans up to kiss Jack on the lips.]

KATE: I'll see you upstairs.

[Kate goes up to bed. Jack fishes into his jacket pocket and extracts his clonazepam prescription. Dropping his keys on the counter, he takes the pill bottle out of the Skadden's Pharmacy envelope, opens the bottle, and takes out two round white pills. He goes to the refrigerator--which is covered with colorful construction-paper art of ladybugs and flowers--and takes out a bottle of Penzburg beer. He twists off the cap, pops the pills in his mouth, and chugs down the beer.]

[Crickets chirp and a campfire crackles in the jungle. Miles is fast asleep. Sawyer snores. Claire stirs awake. Aaron is gone. She looks up to see a white-haired old man rocking the babe in his arms. It's Christian Shephard. Claire gasps.]

CLAIRE: Dad? 

[Surf rolling in distance]

BERNARD: Hey. Don't worry. It went well. She did good. She said you could go back inside if you want to.

KATE: (Sniffles) Thank you.

BERNARD: Okay.

JULIET: He didn't lose that much blood. I got the appendix out and put everything back where it belongs, I think. (Chuckles)

KATE: So he's gonna be okay?

JULIET: He should be fine. We just have to talk him into resting.

KATE: Good luck with that.

[Laughs]

JULIET: I'm sorry I yelled at you.

KATE: Don't worry about it. You had enough going on.

JULIET: You know, he kissed me.

KATE: What?

JULIET: The other day, when you came back from the other side of the Island, Jack kissed me.

KATE: Oh.

JULIET: It was nice. ...But it wasn't for me. It was for him. I'm pretty sure he was trying to prove something.

KATE: Prove what?

JULIET: That he doesn't love someone else.

KATE: Thank you, Juliet. Thank you for saving his life.

[Kate leaves.]

JULIET: I know you're awake.

JACK: Hey.

KATE: Hey. You're home early. Where's Veronica?

JACK: I sent her home. The baby's asleep.

KATE: (Sighs) Good.

[Ice cubes rattle]

JACK: Why was she here?

KATE: Sorry?

JACK: The nanny. She only works till 4:00. I came home at 6:00.

KATE: I had to run some errands, so... (sets keys down) I asked her to stay a couple extra hours. What's going on, Jack? Why are you home so early?

JACK: I went to see Hurley.

KATE: Today?

JACK: Last Friday.

KATE: Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you.

JACK: (Laughs) Because he's crazy, Kate, and I didn't wanna upset you. (Sighs) Where were you today?

KATE: I'm gonna ask you... to trust me. Trust me. Just leave it be.

JACK: (Sighs) Where were you?

KATE: (Whispers) Jack, don't.

JACK: No, I heard you on the phone last night. Who were you talking to?

KATE: Just let it go.

JACK: No, no, I wanna know.

KATE: No, Jack.

JACK: I wanna know where you were. I wanna know who you were with.

KATE: It doesn't matter, Jack. Please.

JACK: No, tell me. Tell me!

KATE: (Sighs) I was doing something for him.

JACK: For who?

KATE: For Sawyer. I made him a promise. It... (sighs)

JACK: (sighs) What?

KATE: It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with us.

JACK: Then why won't you tell me?

KATE: Because--because he wouldn't want me to.

JACK: But he's not here, is he? No. No, he made his choice. He chose to stay. I'm the one who came back. I'm the one who's here. I'm the one who saved you.

KATE: Jack. (Sniffles) You can't--you can't do this. If you have problems, you need to figure them out. All right? 'Cause I can't have you like this around my son.

JACK: Your son? You're not even related to him!

[Gasps]

[They turn to the hallway, where Aaron has awoken and walks into the room with a stuffed animal.]

KATE: Hey, sweet pea. Hey.

[Birds chirping]

[groans]

MILES: Morning.

SAWYER: It's way too early for Chinese. (Grunts) Where's Claire? Ladies' room?

MILES: Nope. She just walked off into the jungle.

SAWYER: What? When?

MILES: In the middle of the night. Just got up and left.

SAWYER: You let her go alone?

MILES: She wasn't alone.

SAWYER: Well, who was she with?

MILES: She called him "Dad". I'd have followed them, but I have a restraining order.

[Chuckles]

[Sawyer grabs Miles and just when he's about to hit him with the handle of his gun, Aaron's cries in distance are heard]

SAWYER: Claire! Claire!

[Crying continues]

[crying]

[wailing]

[whispers]

SAWYER: It's okay. It's okay. I've got you.

[Crying]

SAWYER: Claire! Claire!

[Aaron continues crying]

SAWYER: Claire! Claire!
